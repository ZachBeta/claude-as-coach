### Morning (06:00-09:00)

**06:30** - Woke up naturally, felt rested after 7.5hrs sleep (Garmin 83/100 score)

- Heart rate: Average 142 bpm (Z2), max 156 bpm (low Z3 briefly)
- Felt strong throughout, legs responding well to training adaptation
- No shin pain or acute issues
- Breathing comfortable - could hold conversation during run portions

**08:05** - Cool-down walk complete

## Insights & Learnings

### What This Day Revealed

**Training progress - clear adaptation:**
- Week 4 workouts are noticeably easier than Week 2 was
- Same workout structure (8x Run 5min / Walk 1min) but:
  - Week 2: Struggled, pace 11:15/mi, hit Z3 frequently
  - Week 4: Comfortable, pace 10:45/mi, stayed Z2 throughout
- This is exactly what C25K is designed to do - progressive overload working

**Aerobic base is improving:**
- Maintaining Z2 heart rate (142 bpm avg) even during 5-minute run intervals
- Used to spike into Z3 (160+ bpm) during run portions in early weeks
- This means cardiovascular system is adapting - can sustain faster pace at lower effort
- Pace improving naturally without pushing - went from 11:15/mi to 10:45/mi

**5-minute run intervals are now sustainable:**
- Week 3: These felt hard, counting down the minutes
- Week 4: Comfortable, almost feel like could go longer
- Mental shift: From "how much longer?" to "I can do this"
- This milestone means ready for Week 5's longer continuous runs (20min)

**Sleep quality directly correlates with performance:**
- 7.5hrs sleep last night = strong workout this morning
- Pattern noticed: <7hrs = struggle, 7-8hrs = good, >8hrs = excellent
- This is actionable: prioritize sleep on training eve

**Recovery protocol is working:**
- Post-run protein shake within 30min consistently
- Seems to reduce next-day soreness compared to earlier weeks when skipped this
- Foam rolling in evening helps with tightness
- Active recovery walk made legs feel less tight

## Decisions Made

### What Was Decided

**Training plan adjustments:**
- None needed - current C25K progression working perfectly
- Will proceed with W4-D3 on Friday (same workout as today)
- Week 5 starts Monday - first 20min continuous run, feeling ready for it

**Recovery optimization:**
- Continue current protocol: protein within 30min, stretching, foam rolling
- Add: Evening walk on training days (light active recovery helpful)
- Keep: Prioritizing 7-8hrs sleep before training days

**Nutrition timing:**
- Pre-run banana at 90min before works well (no GI issues)
- Post-run protein + carbs within 30min window is non-negotiable
- Total 2100 cal on training days with slight deficit is sustainable
- Hydration: Need to be more consistent throughout day, not just post-run

**Week 5 preparation:**
- Mental prep: 20min continuous run is next milestone, ready for it
- Physical prep: Current adaptation trajectory says body is ready
- Plan: Maintain current recovery protocols, maybe extra sleep night before

## What Mattered This Day

**Key achievement:** Completed W4-D2 with significant pace improvement while staying aerobic. This proves the training program is working - cardiovascular adaptation is real and measurable.

**Critical insight:** The combination of progressive training load + adequate sleep + proper recovery nutrition creates a clear adaptation response. Missing any piece (saw this in Week 2 when sleep was poor) degrades performance.

**Milestone reached:** 5-minute run intervals are now comfortable. This is the mental and physical transition point in C25K - from "learning to run" to "becoming a runner."

**Path forward:** Continue current trajectory. Body is responding well to training stress. Week 5's 20-minute continuous run is the next significant challenge, but adaptation pattern suggests ready for it.
