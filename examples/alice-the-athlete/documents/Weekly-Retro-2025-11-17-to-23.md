# Weekly Retrospective: November 17-23, 2025

**Week 4 of Couch-to-5K Program**
**Training Days:** Monday 11/17, Wednesday 11/19, Friday 11/21

---

## TL;DR - Week Summary

Week 4 was a breakthrough week. Completed all three training runs with noticeable improvement in both pace (10:45/mi vs 11:15/mi in Week 2) and effort (staying aerobic in Z2 during 5-minute run intervals). Sleep quality directly correlated with workout performance - 7+ hours = strong runs, <7 hours = struggle. Recovery protocol (protein within 30min, foam rolling, stretching) is clearly working. Mental shift happened: 5-minute run intervals now feel comfortable instead of daunting. Body is adapting to training stress exactly as C25K program predicts. Ready for Week 5's first 20-minute continuous run.

**Key wins:** All runs completed, pace improving naturally, aerobic base building, no injuries
**Key learnings:** Sleep is non-negotiable on training nights, recovery nutrition matters, adaptation is real and measurable
**Big milestone:** 5-minute run intervals are now sustainable - transition point from "learning to run" to "becoming a runner"

## What Worked This Week

### Training Execution ✅

**Completed all Week 4 workouts (8x Run 5min / Walk 1min):**
- Monday 11/17: 3.1 miles, average pace 11:05/mi, HR avg 145 bpm (Z2)
- Wednesday 11/19: 3.2 miles, average pace 10:45/mi, HR avg 142 bpm (Z2)
- Friday 11/21: 3.2 miles, average pace 10:50/mi, HR avg 144 bpm (Z2)

**Pace progression is real:**
- Week 2 baseline: 11:15/mi average (struggling, frequently hitting Z3)
- Week 4 now: 10:45/mi average (comfortable, staying Z2)
- **30 seconds per mile improvement in 2 weeks** while feeling easier
- This validates progressive overload approach - cardiovascular system is adapting

**Aerobic base building successful:**
- Consistently staying in Zone 2 during 5-minute run intervals
- Heart rate response improving: same pace at lower HR
- Can hold conversation during run portions now (couldn't in Week 2)
- This is the foundation for longer continuous runs

### Recovery Protocol Working ✅

**Post-run nutrition consistently executed:**
- Protein shake (25g) + chocolate milk within 30 minutes of every run
- Noticed significantly less next-day soreness compared to Week 1-2 when I skipped this
- Recovery window seems to matter - late protein = more DOMS

**Mobility work paying off:**
- Foam rolling after each run (IT bands, calves, quads)
- Evening stretching on training days
- Added light active recovery walks (15min) on run days - legs feel less tight
- No acute pain, just normal training fatigue

**Sleep correlation confirmed:**
- 7.5+ hours = strong workouts (Wed, Fri)
- 6.5 hours = struggled through workout (Mon)
- This is now **data-backed, not anecdotal** - sleep on training eve is non-negotiable

### Mental Progress ✅

**Mindset shift from "can I?" to "I can":**
- Week 2: Counting down seconds during 5-minute runs, watching clock anxiously
- Week 4: Feeling comfortable, almost surprised when interval ends
- This is the psychological adaptation C25K builds - confidence through competence

**Run/walk intervals no longer feel like "cheating":**
- Early weeks: Walk breaks felt like failure
- Week 4: Recognized walk intervals are strategic recovery (that's the program design!)
- Mental reframe: This is training, not testing - process over outcome

## What Didn't Work This Week

### Sleep Inconsistency 😴

**Monday night before Tuesday off-day:**
- Only 6.5 hours sleep (stayed up late Sunday)
- Monday workout was hardest of the week - HR spiked to Z3, pace slower
- Felt "off" throughout the run
- **Experiment:** Prioritize 7-8 hours on nights before training days

**Saturday/Sunday sleep too inconsistent:**
- Weekend sleep schedule drifted (later bedtime, later wake)
- This creates "social jetlag" heading into Monday workouts
- Need consistent sleep timing, not just duration

**Root cause:**
- Sunday evening screen time - scrolling before bed delays sleep onset
- Need earlier evening wind-down routine
- Consider 21:30 "devices down" on training eve

### Hydration Not Consistent 💧

**Morning runs = dehydrated start:**
- Only drinking water post-run, not throughout day
- Noticed darker urine on Friday morning (dehydration marker)
- Pre-run hydration matters for performance

**Experiment for Week 5:**
- Target 64oz water daily, not just post-run chugging
- Morning routine: 16oz water upon waking (before coffee)
- Keep water bottle visible at desk during work

### Nutrition Timing Window 🍽️

**Pre-run fueling still experimental:**
- Wednesday: Banana at 90min before run = good (no GI issues)
- Monday: Ate breakfast too close to run (60min before) = felt heavy
- Friday: Nothing pre-run = felt slightly low energy by 4th interval

**Optimal window seems to be 75-90min before:**
- Too close (< 60min) = GI discomfort, feels heavy
- Too far (> 2hrs) = low energy during latter intervals
- Sweet spot: Light carbs (banana, toast) at 75-90min

**Experiment for Week 5:**
- Standardize pre-run meal: 1 banana + 16oz water at 90min before
- Track any GI issues or energy dips
- Refine based on data

### Week 5 Anxiety Building 😰

**The 20-minute continuous run looms large:**
- Week 5, Day 3 is the first 20-minute run without walk breaks
- Mental buildup: "Can I really run for 20 minutes straight?"
- This is creating unnecessary pre-worry

**Reality check needed:**
- Week 4 runs are 5-minute intervals x 8 = 40 minutes total running time (with walks)
- 20 minutes continuous is **less** total running volume than current workouts
- Body is ready - cardiovascular data proves this (Z2 heart rate, pace improving)
- Mental game needs reframing

**Strategy:**
- Don't over-focus on Week 5 milestone during Week 4 rest/recovery
- Trust the progressive overload program design
- Review data: Week 4 runs show body is adapted and ready

## Progress Tracking

### Week-Over-Week Comparison (W3 → W4)

| Metric | Week 3 | Week 4 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Runs Completed** | 3/3 | 3/3 | ✅ Consistent |
| **Average Pace** | 11:00/mi | 10:45/mi | ⬆️ +15 sec/mi faster |
| **Heart Rate (Z2%)** | 68% | 78% | ⬆️ +10% more aerobic |
| **Average Distance** | 3.0 mi | 3.2 mi | ⬆️ +0.2 mi |
| **Sleep (avg)** | 6.8 hrs | 7.2 hrs | ⬆️ Better on training nights |
| **Post-Run Recovery** | Inconsistent | Consistent | ✅ Protocol established |
| **Soreness Level** | 4/5 | 3/5 | ⬇️ Recovery working |

**Key insight:** Even modest sleep improvement (6.8 → 7.2 hrs avg) correlated with significant performance gains. This suggests sleep optimization is high-leverage input.

### Monthly Progress (Weeks 1-4)

**Cardiovascular adaptation visible:**
- Week 1: Run/walk 60sec/90sec, avg pace 12:30/mi, HR frequently Z3
- Week 4: Run/walk 5min/1min, avg pace 10:45/mi, HR mostly Z2
- **Improvement:** Running 5x longer intervals at 1:45/mi faster pace with lower heart rate

**Weight trend:**
- Week 1 start: 169.5 lbs
- Week 4 end: 168.0 lbs
- Net: -1.5 lbs over 4 weeks (healthy, sustainable rate)

**Injury status:**
- Zero acute injuries
- Normal training soreness only (DOMS in quads, calves)
- Recovery protocol appears protective

**Mental resilience building:**
- Week 1: "Can I even finish the workout?"
- Week 4: "5-minute intervals feel comfortable now"
- Confidence is growing with competence

## Experiments to Run (Week 5)

### Experiment 1: Sleep Prioritization Protocol 😴

**Hypothesis:** Consistent 7-8 hours sleep on nights before training days will improve workout performance and recovery.

**Implementation:**
- Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday nights = strict 22:00 bedtime (training Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- "Devices down" at 21:30 on these nights
- Morning alarm 06:00 = 8 hours sleep window

**Success metric:**
- All Week 5 training runs completed with HR staying in Z2
- Post-workout energy levels rated 7/10 or higher
- Next-day soreness rated 3/5 or lower

**If this works:** Make it permanent protocol for all training weeks

### Experiment 2: Daily Hydration Target 💧

**Hypothesis:** Consistent hydration (64oz daily) will improve run performance and recovery markers.

**Implementation:**
- Morning routine: 16oz water upon waking (before coffee)
- Work hours: 32oz (refill 16oz bottle twice)
- Evening: 16oz minimum
- Track: Urine color check (aim for pale yellow)

**Success metric:**
- Morning urine consistently pale yellow
- No mid-run dehydration symptoms (dry mouth, dizziness)
- Post-run recovery feels smoother

**Data to collect:** Urine color morning check (simple visual)

### Experiment 3: Standardized Pre-Run Fueling ⏰

**Hypothesis:** 1 banana + 16oz water at exactly 90 minutes before run = optimal energy without GI issues.

**Implementation:**
- Set timer/alarm for 90min before planned run start
- Consume: 1 medium banana + 16oz water
- No other food closer than 90min to run

**Success metric:**
- No GI discomfort during any Week 5 runs
- Energy levels feel consistent through all run intervals
- No "bonking" feeling in latter portions

**Iteration:** If 90min doesn't work, try 75min or 105min

## Gratitude & Wins

**Grateful for:**
- Body's resilience - adapting to training stress without injury
- C25K program design - progressive overload is working exactly as designed
- Morning runs - starting day with physical accomplishment sets good tone
- Recovery knowledge - foam rolling, protein timing, stretching protocol all accessible via research

**Small wins that mattered:**
- Completed every scheduled run this week (consistency building)
- Didn't skip post-run protein even when tired (discipline paying off)
- Recognized rest days are part of training (not laziness)
- Pace improving naturally without "trying harder" (trusting the process)

**Mindset shift:**
- From "I'm not a runner" (Week 1) to "I'm learning to run" (Week 4)
- This is progress in self-concept, not just physical capacity

## Week 5 Preview

**Key workouts:**
- W5-D1 (Mon): Run 5min, walk 3min, run 5min, walk 3min, run 5min
- W5-D2 (Wed): Run 8min, walk 5min, run 8min
- W5-D3 (Fri): **Run 20 minutes continuous** ← BIG MILESTONE

**Anticipated challenges:**
- Mental barrier of 20-minute continuous run (longest ever)
- Maintaining Z2 heart rate without walk break recovery
- Confidence management if early intervals feel hard

**Preparation strategy:**
- Trust the data: Week 4 shows body is ready (cardiovascular adaptation proven)
- Sleep prioritization experiment (7-8hrs on training nights)
- Hydration and fueling experiments to optimize performance
- Mental reframe: 20min continuous is less total volume than current 40min intervals

**Success definition for Week 5:**
- Complete all three runs (especially the 20min milestone)
- Stay injury-free
- Maintain Z2 aerobic heart rate during runs
- Validate sleep/hydration/fueling experiments
- Build confidence for Week 6 progression
