# Couch-to-5K Training Plan

8-week program to build from no running to completing a 5K (3.1 miles).

## Program Overview

**Goal:** Run 5K continuously by end of Week 8
**Frequency:** 3 training days per week (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Format:** Run/walk intervals → continuous running

## Weekly Progression

### Week 1-2: Building Base
**Focus:** Get body used to running motion

- **Week 1:** 6x (Run 1min / Walk 1.5min)
- **Week 2:** 6x (Run 2min / Walk 1.5min)

### Week 3-4: Extending Run Intervals
**Focus:** Increase run duration, reduce walk breaks

- **Week 3:** 6x (Run 3min / Walk 1min)
- **Week 4:** 8x (Run 5min / Walk 1min)

### Week 5-6: Building Endurance
**Focus:** Longer continuous runs

- **Week 5:**
  - D1: 5min run, 3min walk, 5min run, 3min walk, 5min run
  - D2: 8min run, 5min walk, 8min run
  - D3: 20min run (no walk breaks)
- **Week 6:**
  - D1: 2x (10min run / 3min walk)
  - D2: 2x (12min run / 2min walk)
  - D3: 25min run

### Week 7-8: Race Prep
**Focus:** Run full distance

- **Week 7:** 3x (25-28min continuous run)
- **Week 8:** 3x (30min continuous run = 5K at easy pace)

## Heart Rate Zones (Example: 35yo, Max HR 185)

- **Z1 (Recovery):** 111-130 bpm (60-70%) - Warm-up, cool-down
- **Z2 (Aerobic):** 130-148 bpm (70-80%) - Primary training zone
- **Z3 (Tempo):** 148-167 bpm (80-90%) - Occasional, not sustainable

**Goal:** Stay in Z2 for all training runs.

## Pace Guidance

**Week 1-3:** Don't worry about pace, focus on completing intervals
**Week 4-5:** Comfortable pace, should be able to talk (11-12 min/mi typical)
**Week 6-7:** Find sustainable pace (10:30-11:00 min/mi)
**Week 8:** Work toward sub-10:00 min/mi for 5K goal

## Recovery Protocol

**Immediately Post-Run:**
- 5min cool-down walk
- Protein + carbs within 30min (shake, chocolate milk, eggs + toast)
- Hydrate: 16-20oz water

**Within 1 Hour:**
- Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves, hip flexors)
- Foam rolling (IT bands, calves, quads)

**Rest Days (4 per week):**
- Active recovery: 15-30min walk, yoga, stretching
- NO running - muscles need repair time
- Foam rolling and mobility work

## Nutrition

**Training Days:**
- Total: 2000-2300 calories (slight deficit if weight loss goal)
- Pre-run (90min before): Light carbs (banana, toast + PB)
- Post-run (within 30min): Protein (20-30g) + carbs
- Throughout: 10+ glasses water

**Rest Days:**
- Total: 1800-2000 calories
- Focus on protein for muscle repair
- 8-10 glasses water

## Sleep Targets

- **Training days:** 7-8 hours minimum
- **Rest days:** 7-9 hours
- **<7 hours:** Performance degrades, consider easier workout

## Warning Signs

**Normal (Expected):**
- Muscle soreness 24-48hrs after run (DOMS)
- Fatigue during/after workout
- Mild shin discomfort that goes away with walking

**Not Normal (Stop & Assess):**
- Sharp, stabbing pain
- Pain that persists when walking
- Swelling or visible injury
- Chest pain or severe breathlessness
- Dizziness or nausea

## Overtraining Signals

- Elevated resting heart rate (5+ bpm above baseline)
- Persistent fatigue despite rest
- Declining performance (slower pace at same effort)
- Poor sleep quality
- Loss of motivation lasting 3+ days

**Response:** Take 2-3 extra rest days, reduce volume 20-30% for next week.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too fast too soon:** Running too hard in early weeks
2. **Skipping rest days:** Body needs recovery to adapt
3. **Poor nutrition:** Especially skipping post-run protein
4. **Inadequate sleep:** <7hrs = degraded performance
5. **Ignoring pain:** Distinguish between discomfort and injury
6. **Not hydrating:** Throughout day, not just around runs

## Success Metrics

**Week 4 (Halfway):**
- 5-minute run intervals feel comfortable
- Staying in Z2 during run portions
- Pace naturally improving without pushing
- DOMS decreasing compared to Week 2

**Week 8 (Complete):**
- Can run 30 minutes continuously
- Complete 5K (3.1 miles) at comfortable pace
- Sub-10:00 min/mi pace goal
- Running feels sustainable, not a struggle

## Notes

This is a **sample plan**. Actual C25K programs may vary. Listen to your body and adjust as needed. Some people need extra weeks - that's normal and fine. The goal is injury-free progression, not speed.
