# Weekly Plan: November 24-30, 2025

**Week 5 of Couch-to-5K Program**
**Training Days:** Monday 11/24, Wednesday 11/26, Friday 11/28

---

## Coming From (Current State)

### Week 4 Results

**Training performance:**
- ✅ All three runs completed successfully
- ✅ Pace improving: 10:45/mi avg (from 11:15/mi in Week 2)
- ✅ Heart rate staying aerobic: 78% in Zone 2 during run intervals
- ✅ 5-minute run intervals now feel comfortable and sustainable
- ✅ Zero injuries, just normal training soreness

**Key validated insights:**
- Sleep quality directly correlates with workout performance (7+ hours = strong runs)
- Post-run protein within 30min significantly reduces next-day soreness
- Recovery protocol (foam rolling, stretching, active recovery walks) is working
- Cardiovascular adaptation is real and measurable - body is responding to training stress

**Body is ready for Week 5:**
- Can sustain 5-minute run intervals comfortably in Z2
- Pace naturally improving without "trying harder"
- Recovery between workouts is good (3/5 soreness, down from 4/5 in Week 3)
- Mental shift happened: from "can I?" to "I can" - confidence building

### Week 5 Structure (The Big Step)

**Monday W5-D1:** Run 5min, walk 3min, run 5min, walk 3min, run 5min (15min total running)

**Wednesday W5-D2:** Run 8min, walk 5min, run 8min (16min total running)

**Friday W5-D3:** **Run 20 minutes continuous** ← MAJOR MILESTONE

**The psychological barrier:**
- This is the first time running for 20 minutes without a walk break
- Feels like a big jump from 5-8 minute intervals
- Reality check: Week 4 workouts were 40 minutes of running (5min x 8 intervals)
- 20 minutes continuous is actually **less total running volume**
- Body is adapted - cardiovascular data proves this

### Current Capacity Assessment

**Physical capacity: HIGH** (data-backed)
- Aerobic base established (Z2 heart rate during 5min intervals)
- Pace improving naturally (cardiovascular system adapting)
- Recovery working (no acute injuries, manageable soreness)
- Sleep improving (7.2 hrs avg Week 4 vs 6.8 hrs Week 3)

**Mental capacity: MEDIUM** (some anxiety)
- Confidence built from Week 4 success
- But: 20-minute milestone creates pre-worry ("What if I can't do it?")
- Need mental reframe: Trust the process, trust the data

**Time capacity: GOOD**
- Training schedule: Mon/Wed/Fri mornings (established routine)
- No major conflicts this week
- Rest days are protected (Tues/Thurs/Sat/Sun)

**Recovery capacity: GOOD**
- Post-run protocol established (protein, foam rolling, stretching)
- Sleep strategy ready to implement (7-8hrs on training nights)
- Hydration experiment ready (64oz daily target)

---

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Non-Negotiable Constraints

**Training plan rest days:**
- C25K requires rest days between runs for adaptation
- Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday = no running
- Active recovery (walking, light stretching) is fine

**Friday W5-D3 is the milestone workout:**
- This is the 20-minute continuous run
- Cannot skip this one - it's psychologically and physically important
- Need optimal conditions: good sleep Thursday night, proper fueling Friday morning

**Injury prevention:**
- Any acute pain (not normal soreness) = stop workout, don't push through
- Shin splints, sharp knee pain, ankle issues = immediate rest required
- Recovery protocol is non-negotiable (protein, foam rolling, stretching)

### Soft Constraints

**Sleep target: 7-8 hours on training nights (Sun/Tues/Thurs):**
- Devices down at 21:30
- Bedtime 22:00, wake 06:00
- This is Experiment #1 from Week 4 retro

**Hydration target: 64oz daily:**
- 16oz upon waking
- 32oz during work hours
- 16oz evening minimum
- This is Experiment #2 from Week 4 retro

**Pre-run fueling window: 90 minutes before:**
- 1 banana + 16oz water
- Standardized timing to optimize energy without GI issues
- This is Experiment #3 from Week 4 retro

### What Can Flex

**Workout timing:**
- Preferred: 07:00-08:00 morning runs
- Can shift to 06:30 or 08:00 if needed for schedule
- Avoid: Evening runs (sleep disruption)

**Cross-training:**
- Optional light walks on rest days (active recovery)
- Not required, but helpful for recovery
- Keep intensity LOW (conversational pace)

---

## Week 5 Priorities (Maximum 2-3)

### Priority #1: Complete W5-D3 (20-Minute Continuous Run) 🎯

**Why this matters:**
- Psychological milestone: First time running 20 minutes without walk break
- Physical milestone: Proves aerobic base is built
- Confidence builder: "I'm becoming a runner" vs "I'm learning to run"
- Program pivot point: Week 6-8 build on this foundation

**Success criteria:**
- Complete full 20 minutes of continuous running (no walk breaks)
- Maintain Z2 heart rate throughout (stay aerobic, don't redline)
- Finish feeling strong (not completely depleted)
- Post-run: Sense of accomplishment, not defeat

**Setup for success:**
- Thursday night: 7-8 hours sleep (non-negotiable)
- Friday morning: Banana + 16oz water at exactly 90min before run
- Friday pre-run: Positive self-talk - "I'm ready, the data proves it"
- During run: Focus on breathing, pace by feel (not watch), trust training

**Risk mitigation:**
- If HR spikes to Z3 early: Slow down pace, breathing comes first
- If mental panic mid-run: Break it into mental chunks (5min at a time)
- If acute pain appears: Stop workout, don't force through injury risk

### Priority #2: Execute Sleep/Hydration/Fueling Experiments 💤💧⏰

**Why this matters:**
- Week 4 retro identified these as high-leverage inputs
- Sleep correlation with performance is data-backed (not anecdotal)
- Hydration affects recovery markers
- Pre-run fueling timing impacts energy and GI comfort

**Sleep Experiment:**
- Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday nights: 22:00 bedtime, 06:00 wake (8hrs)
- Devices down at 21:30 on these nights
- Track: Sleep duration + next-day workout quality

**Hydration Experiment:**
- Daily target: 64oz water (16oz morning, 32oz work, 16oz evening)
- Track: Morning urine color check (visual)
- Success: Pale yellow consistently, no mid-run dehydration

**Fueling Experiment:**
- Pre-run timing: 1 banana + 16oz water at exactly 90min before
- Track: GI comfort + energy levels during run
- Success: No GI issues, no energy dips in latter intervals

**Data collection:**
- Sleep: Simple duration + subjective workout quality (scale 1-10)
- Hydration: Morning urine color (simple visual check)
- Fueling: GI comfort (yes/no) + energy (scale 1-10)

### Priority #3: Maintain Recovery Protocol (Injury Prevention) 🛡️

**Why this matters:**
- Week 5 is biggest training stress yet (20min continuous run)
- Increased training load = increased injury risk if recovery poor
- Currently injury-free - want to keep it that way
- Recovery protocol from Week 4 is working (keep what works)

**Post-run protocol (every training day):**
1. Protein shake (25g) + chocolate milk within 30 minutes
2. Static stretching: quads, hamstrings, calves, hip flexors (15min)
3. Foam rolling: IT bands, calves, quads
4. Hydration: 20oz water immediately post-run

**Rest day protocol:**
- Light active recovery walk (15min) if legs feel tight
- Evening foam rolling if soreness present
- Prioritize sleep (see Experiment #1)

**Listen to body signals:**
- Normal: Muscle soreness (DOMS), fatigue, tightness
- Concerning: Sharp pain, swelling, pain that worsens, asymmetric pain
- If concerning: Rest, ice, evaluate - don't push through

---

## Experiments This Week

### Experiment #1: Sleep Prioritization Protocol 😴

**From Week 4 retro:** Sleep quality directly correlates with workout performance (7+ hrs = strong runs, <7 hrs = struggle)

**Hypothesis:** Consistent 7-8 hours sleep on nights before training days will improve workout performance and recovery.

**Implementation:**
- Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday nights = 22:00 bedtime, 06:00 wake (8 hours)
- "Devices down" protocol at 21:30 on training-eve nights
- Evening wind-down routine: Light stretching, no screens, bedroom cool/dark

**Success metrics:**
- All three Week 5 runs completed with HR staying in Z2 (aerobic)
- Post-workout energy rated 7/10 or higher (not depleted)
- Next-day soreness 3/5 or lower (manageable DOMS)

**Data to collect:**
- Sleep duration each night (Garmin tracks automatically)
- Subjective workout quality (1-10 scale) for each run
- Next-day soreness rating (1-5 scale)

**If successful:** Make this permanent protocol for all training weeks going forward

---

### Experiment #2: Daily Hydration Target 💧

**From Week 4 retro:** Hydration inconsistent, noticed darker urine on Friday morning (dehydration marker)

**Hypothesis:** Consistent 64oz daily hydration will improve run performance and recovery markers.

**Implementation:**
- Morning routine: 16oz water upon waking (before coffee)
- Work hours: Refill 16oz bottle twice (32oz total during 09:00-17:00)
- Evening: 16oz minimum with dinner
- Visual tracking: Morning urine color check

**Success metrics:**
- Morning urine consistently pale yellow (hydration marker)
- No mid-run dehydration symptoms (dry mouth, dizziness, early fatigue)
- Post-run recovery feels smoother (subjective, but track it)

**Data to collect:**
- Morning urine color: Dark yellow / Medium / Pale yellow (simple visual)
- Mid-run hydration comfort: Any issues? (yes/no)
- Daily water intake estimate (track water bottle refills)

**If successful:** Maintain 64oz baseline, may increase to 80oz on hot days or harder workouts

---

### Experiment #3: Standardized Pre-Run Fueling ⏰

**From Week 4 retro:** Pre-run fueling timing still experimental - too close = GI issues, too far = low energy

**Hypothesis:** 1 banana + 16oz water at exactly 90 minutes before run = optimal energy without GI issues.

**Implementation:**
- Set timer/alarm for 90 minutes before planned run start time
- Consume: 1 medium banana + 16oz water
- No other food within 90-minute window before run (only water if thirsty)

**Success metrics:**
- Zero GI discomfort during any Week 5 runs (no nausea, cramping, urgency)
- Energy levels feel consistent through all run intervals (no bonking)
- No "heavy stomach" feeling during early intervals

**Data to collect:**
- GI comfort during run: Yes (comfortable) / No (issues)
- Energy levels during run: 1-10 scale
- Timing logged: Actual minutes between eating and run start

**If 90min doesn't work:** Next iteration try 75min or 105min to find sweet spot

---

## Success Levels (L0-L3)

### Level 0: Minimum Success (Non-Negotiable Baseline)

**Core criteria:**
- ✅ All three Week 5 workouts completed (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- ✅ W5-D3 20-minute continuous run achieved (even if slow/hard)
- ✅ Injury-free (no acute pain, normal DOMS only)
- ✅ Sleep/hydration/fueling experiments attempted (even if imperfect)
- ✅ Recovery protocol maintained (protein, stretching, foam rolling)

**Why this is L0:**
- Completing workouts = staying on program (adaptation continues)
- Injury prevention = ability to continue training (don't break the streak)
- Experiments attempted = data collected for iteration

**If Week 5 achieves L0:** On track for C25K program completion, Week 6 can proceed as planned

---

### Level 1: Target Success (What I'm Aiming For)

**Everything in L0, plus:**
- ✅ W5-D3 20-minute run feels **strong** (not just survived, but felt good)
- ✅ All three runs maintain Z2 heart rate throughout (stayed aerobic)
- ✅ Sleep experiment successful: 7-8 hours on all three training-eve nights
- ✅ Hydration experiment successful: Morning urine pale yellow consistently
- ✅ Fueling experiment successful: No GI issues, good energy all runs
- ✅ Post-workout energy ratings 7/10 or higher (feeling strong, not depleted)

**Why this is L1:**
- Strong 20-minute run = aerobic base is solid, ready for Week 6 progression
- Z2 heart rate = training at right intensity, not overreaching
- Experiments validated = high-leverage inputs confirmed, can optimize further

**If Week 5 achieves L1:** High confidence heading into Week 6, training adaptations are working as designed

---

### Level 2: Stretch Success (Exceeding Expectations)

**Everything in L1, plus:**
- ✅ W5-D3 20-minute run **felt easy** (could have kept going)
- ✅ Pace improvement: Averaging 10:30/mi or faster (from 10:45/mi Week 4)
- ✅ Zero soreness issues: Recovery so good that DOMS is 2/5 or lower
- ✅ Mental breakthrough: "I'm a runner" self-concept shift happens
- ✅ Experiments create measurable improvement: Sleep nights = 1-2 point better workout quality

**Why this is L2:**
- Easy 20-minute run = ready for longer runs ahead (body has capacity headroom)
- Continued pace improvement = cardiovascular adaptation accelerating
- Mental self-concept shift = psychological foundation for long-term running

**If Week 5 achieves L2:** Ahead of program curve, might consider Week 6 modifications (consult program guidance)

---

### Level 3: Exceptional Success (Breakthrough Week)

**Everything in L2, plus:**
- ✅ W5-D3 20-minute run is a **breakthrough experience** (runner's high, flow state)
- ✅ All experiments succeed perfectly: Data shows clear cause-effect relationships
- ✅ Week 5 creates momentum shift: From "training is hard" to "training is sustainable"
- ✅ Confidence level spikes: Belief that 5K completion is inevitable, not uncertain
- ✅ Recovery so good that considering adding optional light cross-training

**Why this is L3:**
- Breakthrough experiences create lasting motivation (psychological fuel for hard weeks)
- Perfect experiments = system is optimized, can focus on execution not troubleshooting
- Momentum shift = training becomes self-reinforcing (intrinsic motivation building)

**If Week 5 achieves L3:** This is a pivot point week - running becomes identity, not just activity

**Focus:** Optimal sleep for Friday's 20-minute run

- This is THE critical night for sleep (Experiment #1)
- Devices down 21:30, bedtime 22:00 (no exceptions)
- Light stretching before bed
- Mental prep: Visualize successful 20-minute run, trust the data
- Prep: Banana ready, hydration bottle filled, workout clothes laid out

**Mental game:**
- Review Week 4 data: You ran 40 minutes total with intervals, 20min continuous is less volume
- Review Z2 heart rate: Your cardiovascular system is ready
- Reframe anxiety: Excitement, not fear - this is a milestone you've earned

---

### Friday 11/28 - W5-D3 (MILESTONE DAY)

**Workout:** **Run 20 minutes continuous** (no walk breaks)

**Morning routine:**
- 06:00 wake (critical: 8 hours sleep from Thursday night)
- 06:15 - 16oz water immediately
- 06:30 - Pre-run fueling: 1 banana + 16oz water (90min window)
- 07:00 - Light dynamic warmup, mental prep
- 07:15-07:35 - **20-minute continuous run**
- 07:40 - Cool-down walk (5min)
- 07:45 - Recovery protocol (extra care today - biggest workout yet)

**During the run (mental strategy):**
- First 5 minutes: Settle into pace, focus on breathing (this is familiar territory)
- Minutes 5-10: Find rhythm, conversational pace, check HR (stay Z2)
- Minutes 10-15: Mental check-in, break into 5min chunks if needed
- Minutes 15-20: "I'm doing it" - finish strong, savor the accomplishment

**If struggle happens mid-run:**
- Slow down pace (finishing is success, speed doesn't matter)
- Focus on breathing: In through nose, out through mouth
- Mental chunks: "Just 5 more minutes" (repeat as needed)
- Don't stop: Walk breaks reset the milestone, slow jog still counts

**Data to collect:**
- Sleep duration Thursday night (was sleep experiment successful?)
- Workout quality rating (1-10)
- How did 20 minutes feel? (hard/manageable/easy)
- Heart rate % in Z2 (stay aerobic = success)
- Pace average (don't chase speed, just capture data)
- Post-run emotion: Accomplishment? Relief? Pride? Exhaustion?

**Evening:**
- Celebrate appropriately (this is a MAJOR milestone)
- Extra recovery: Foam rolling, stretching, maybe ice bath if sore
- Reflect on accomplishment: You just ran 20 minutes without stopping

---

### Weekend 11/29-30 (Rest & Reflect)

**Focus:** Recovery + weekly reflection

**Saturday:**
- Rest day (body needs recovery from Friday milestone)
- Light active recovery walk optional
- Foam rolling if any lingering soreness
- Hydration maintenance (64oz target still applies)

**Sunday:**
- Rest day
- **Weekly retrospective:** Reflect on Week 5 (what worked, what didn't, experiments validated?)
- **Weekly planning:** Prep for Week 6 (what's next, what to adjust)
- Evening: Sleep prioritization for Monday (Week 6 starts)

**Retro focus questions:**
- Did sleep/hydration/fueling experiments work? (data analysis)
- How did 20-minute milestone go? (physical + mental)
- What surprised me this week?
- What needs adjustment for Week 6?

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk #1: Mental Panic During 20-Minute Run

**Likelihood:** Medium (this is new territory, anxiety is normal)

**Impact:** Could cause premature stopping, fail to complete milestone

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-run visualization Thursday night (mental rehearsal)
- During run: Break into 5-minute chunks mentally
- Mantra: "I've trained for this, the data proves I'm ready"
- Pace by feel, not watch - conversational pace is correct pace
- If panic hits: Slow down, don't stop - slow jog still achieves milestone

---

### Risk #2: Sleep Experiment Fails (Couldn't Get 7-8 Hours)

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (life happens, might not control all factors)

**Impact:** Workout performance degraded, but not catastrophic

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize Thursday night sleep above all (Friday milestone is most critical)
- If Monday/Wednesday sleep fails, still attempt workouts (they're shorter)
- Backup: If Friday sleep fails but workout feels bad early, consider shifting to Saturday (program allows flexibility)

---

### Risk #3: Injury During Week 5 Workouts

**Likelihood:** Low (currently injury-free, recovery protocol working)

**Impact:** High (would derail C25K program, need rest/recovery time)

**Mitigation:**
- Strict adherence to recovery protocol (protein, stretching, foam rolling)
- Listen to body: Sharp pain = stop immediately, don't push through
- Differentiate: Muscle soreness (DOMS) is normal, joint/tendon pain is concerning
- If injury occurs: Rest, ice, evaluate before next workout (skip workout if needed)

---

### Risk #4: GI Issues from Pre-Run Fueling

**Likelihood:** Low (90-minute window should be safe based on Week 4 data)

**Impact:** Medium (uncomfortable during run, might slow pace or cause walk breaks)

**Mitigation:**
- Stick to simple carb: Just banana, no experiments with new foods
- 90-minute window should provide enough digestion time
- If GI issues occur Mon/Wed, adjust timing for Friday (try 105min or skip pre-run fuel)
- Keep run pace conversational (reduces GI distress vs hard effort)

---

## Success Definition for Week 5

**Week 5 is successful if:**
1. All three workouts completed (especially Friday's 20-minute milestone)
2. Injury-free throughout (normal soreness only)
3. Sleep/hydration/fueling experiments attempted (data collected for iteration)
4. 20-minute run completed while staying aerobic (Z2 heart rate)
5. Confidence built: "I can run 20 minutes" becomes proven fact, not hope

**Week 5 is a breakthrough if:**
- 20-minute run feels strong/manageable (not just survived)
- Experiments validate: Sleep/hydration/fueling show clear cause-effect
- Mental shift: "I'm becoming a runner" → "I am a runner"
- Ready for Week 6 with high confidence

**Week 5 fails if:**
- Injury occurs that prevents training (only failure mode that matters)
- Everything else is iteration and data collection
