# Summary-2025-12-01-Monday-W9-D1

**Date:** Monday, December 1, 2025
**Context:** Week 9, Day 1 - First week post-program

## TL;DR

First day of "what comes next." Ran 3 miles maintenance pace - felt easy, almost boring after the intensity of Week 8. That's good? Talked to wife about yoga tonight. She lit up when I brought it up. We watched a sample class together (didn't do it, just watched). Honestly... it looks harder than I expected. But also, seeing her excited about potentially doing this together made me want to try.

##  Key Numbers

- **Run distance:** 3.0 miles
- **Run duration:** ~35 minutes
- **Average pace:** ~11:40 min/mi (comfortable, conversational)
- **Heart rate average:** ~145 bpm (lower than usual - wasn't pushing)
- **Morning weight:** 191 lbs (stable)
- **Sleep:** 7 hours
- **Pre-run energy:** 7/10
- **Post-run energy:** 8/10

## Timeline

**7:00 AM** - Morning run
- Same route as last week
- Felt easy - almost *too* easy
- Realized: I'm not training for anything now
- That's... weird? Liberating? Aimless?

**8:30 AM** - Work day begins
- Normal Monday (quarterly reports prep)
- Energy good throughout day

**6:30 PM** - Dinner with family
- Kids asked: "Dad, are you still running?"
- Me: "Yeah, I'm still running. But also figuring out what else."
- Kids: "Can we do yoga with you and Mom?"
- (Oh no, now it's a whole family thing?)

**7:30 PM** - Yoga conversation with wife
- Me: "Hey, you've been asking about yoga for a while..."
- Her: *eyes light up* "Are you actually interested or just being nice?"
- Me: "Honestly? 60% curious, 40% guilty for saying no for 2 years."
- Her: "That's fair. Let's watch a class together, see if you hate it."

**8:00 PM** - Watched yoga class (didn't participate)
- Found beginner class on YouTube (20 minutes)
- Watched her do it, I sat on couch observing
- Observations:
  - Slower than I expected (thought yoga was just stretching)
  - Balance poses look impossible for me
  - Breathing patterns seem... important? (I'm bad at breathing)
  - Wife looked peaceful afterwards (she's done yoga before, inconsistently)

**8:30 PM** - Post-yoga debrief
- Her: "So?"
- Me: "Looks harder than I thought. But... I'll try it Wednesday."
- Her: "Really? You don't have to just because I want to."
- Me: "I know. But I'm in this weird space where running feels easy now, and I need *something* that challenges me differently."
- Her: "Yoga will definitely challenge you differently." *laughs*

## What Worked

**Maintenance run felt sustainable:**
- Not trying to go faster or longer
- Just maintaining the 3x/week habit
- This feels right for now

**Honest conversation with wife:**
- Didn't promise to love yoga
- But committed to trying it
- She appreciated the honesty (and the effort)

**Watching before doing:**
- Smart move - less intimidating than jumping in blind
- Gave me realistic expectations
- Lowered performance pressure

**Kids' interest:**
- Them asking if I'm still running = accountability
- Their enthusiasm for family yoga = potential motivation
- (Or potential disaster if we all try together?)

## What Didn't Work

**The "now what?" feeling:**
- Ran 3 miles, felt easy, then... what?
- Missing the structure of "Week 8, Day X" goals
- Feels aimless compared to program

**Overthinking the decision:**
- Spent work downtime researching yoga vs calisthenics vs 10K
- Classic analysis paralysis
- Need to just TRY things, not just think about them

**Sleep not prioritized:**
- Only 7 hours (vs 7.5-8 during program)
- Slipping back into old habits?
- Need to protect sleep even without program structure

## Insights

**The habit is solid, but the purpose shifted:**
- Week 1-8: "Can I do this?"
- Week 9: "What do I want this to be?"
- Same activity, different meaning

**"Easy" doesn't mean "done":**
- Today's run felt easy
- That's progress (it would have killed me 8 weeks ago)
- But "easy" makes me want new challenges
- Human nature: seek difficulty at the edge of ability

**Seeing my wife excited matters:**
- Her face when I said I'd try yoga = worth it
- This isn't just about me anymore
- Fitness as shared experience (not solo achievement)

**I'm in exploration mode, and that's okay:**
- Don't need to commit to 10K or yoga or calisthenics today
- This week is permission to try without deciding
- That's a different kind of discipline (patience, not intensity)

**Structure helped me succeed:**
- Couch-to-5K told me exactly what to do
- Now I'm in "figure it out" mode
- That's less comfortable - but maybe that's growth?

**The kids are watching:**
- They noticed I finished the program
- They're watching to see what I do next
- Modeling: persistence isn't one-time achievement, it's practice

## Tomorrow's Focus

**Rest day protocols:**
- Active recovery: 20-minute walk after work
- Foam rolling
- Hydrate well

**Research (minimal):**
- Browse one calisthenics program (Reddit recommendations)
- No more than 30 minutes research
- Bias toward action, not analysis

**Mental game:**
- Notice: What am I avoiding by researching vs. trying?
- Trust: The yoga experiment Wednesday will teach me more than hours of reading

## Notes

- Week 9 = post-achievement space
- No external structure, have to create internal structure
- That's scarier than following a program
- But also: this is what sustainable practice looks like
- Programs end. Practices continue.

**Question for the week:** What do I actually *want* to do (vs. what makes logical sense)?

**Commitment:** Try yoga Wednesday with no agenda except curiosity.
