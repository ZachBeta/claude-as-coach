# Weekly-Plan-2025-12-01-to-07-W9

**Week:** December 1-7, 2025 (Week 9 - Post-Program)
**Context:** First week after completing couch-to-5K program

## Week Overview

**The transition week:** Program complete, now what?

Last week I finished the couch-to-5K program. 8 weeks, 24 runs, 13 lbs lost, went from couldn't-run-5-minutes to running 3+ miles continuously. That's real progress.

But now I'm in this weird space: **I proved I could do it. What comes next?**

The goal wasn't "complete a program" - it was "be the dad who can play with his kids without getting winded." Mission accomplished there. But if I just stop, I'll slide back. I know how this goes.

So this week is about figuring out: **What's the sustainable practice that comes after the achievement?**

## Options I'm Considering

### Option 1: Train for 10K

**The case FOR:**
- Natural progression (5K → 10K)
- I already have the running habit
- Structured program exists (similar to couch-to-5K)
- Proven that progressive overload works for me

**The case AGAINST:**
- Do I actually *want* to run longer distances?
- Or am I just defaulting to "more of the same"?
- Running 6+ miles feels like diminishing returns
- Risk: chasing performance instead of sustainability

**Honest assessment:** This feels safe. Maybe too safe?

### Option 2: Yoga with Wife (At-Home Online Classes)

**The case FOR:**
- Wife has been asking me to try yoga for years
- Flexibility/recovery would complement running
- Couple activity = quality time together
- At-home = no gym commute, fits schedule
- Balance to the running (yin to yang?)

**The case AGAINST:**
- Never done yoga, might feel awkward/intimidating
- Not sure if I'll stick with it (new domain)
- Do I have mental space for two practices?
- Risk: overcommitting and doing neither well

**Honest assessment:** This sounds good for relationship + body, but am I actually interested or just feeling guilty for saying no to her for 2 years?

### Option 3: Calisthenics / Bodyweight Strength

**The case FOR:**
- Functional strength (useful for life, not just sport)
- Complement running (injury prevention, power)
- At-home, minimal equipment
- Scalable (can progress indefinitely)
- Kids might join in (make it family activity)

**The case AGAINST:**
- Another new thing (not as established as running now)
- Risk of injury if form is bad
- Less intrinsically motivating than running (for me)
- Do I actually care about getting stronger?

**Honest assessment:** Makes logical sense. But logic ≠ motivation.

### Option 4: Maintain Running (3x/week) + Explore Casually

**The case FOR:**
- Don't lose what I built (running habit is solid now)
- Give myself space to figure out what I actually want
- Try yoga once, try calisthenics once, see what clicks
- No pressure, no new "program"

**The case AGAINST:**
- Risk of drifting without structure
- Might just default to coasting
- Program structure *worked* for me - why abandon it?

**Honest assessment:** This feels responsible... or is it just avoiding commitment?

## What I Actually Know

**1. The running habit is solid.**
- I don't want to lose it. 3x/week feels sustainable.
- But I don't need to do *more* running right now.

**2. I miss variety.**
- 8 weeks of running-only was fine because it was time-bound.
- But forever? I'll get bored.

**3. I'm better with structure.**
- Couch-to-5K worked because it told me what to do.
- "Figure it out yourself" hasn't worked for me historically.

**4. The real goal is sustainability.**
- Not performance, not achievement.
- Can I stay active for the next 10, 20, 30 years?
- That requires variety, enjoyment, adaptation.

**5. My wife's opinion matters.**
- She's been supportive of my running.
- She's asked about yoga multiple times.
- Couple activities strengthen relationship.
- But: I can't do it *only* for her. Has to work for me too.

## This Week's Plan

**Decision: I'm NOT deciding this week.**

Instead, I'm going to:
- Maintain running (3x/week at 3-mile pace, no pressure)
- Try yoga with wife (at least once, maybe twice)
- Research calisthenics programs (just browsing, no commitment)
- See what feels right

**Why this approach:**
- I just finished a big goal. Give myself space.
- Try before committing.
- The next practice has to be intrinsically motivating, not just logical.

## Weekly Schedule

### Monday, December 1
- **Morning:** Run 3 miles (maintenance, comfortable pace)
- **Evening:** Talk to wife about yoga options (what programs? how long? schedule?)

### Tuesday, December 2
- **Rest day**
- Browse calisthenics programs online (Reddit? YouTube?)

### Wednesday, December 3
- **Morning:** Run 3 miles
- **Evening:** Try yoga with wife (first session - keep expectations low)

### Thursday, December 4
- **Rest day**
- Reflect: How did yoga feel? Interesting? Awkward? Want to try again?

### Friday, December 5
- **Morning:** Run 3 miles
- **Afternoon:** Play with kids (tag, catch, etc.)

### Saturday, December 6
- **Morning:** Optional second yoga session with wife (if first one went well)
- **OR:** Try one calisthenics workout (bodyweight basics)

### Sunday, December 7
- **Rest / family day**
- Weekly retro: What did I learn this week? What direction feels right?

## Success Levels

**L0 (Minimum - Must Happen):**
- Run 3x this week (maintain the habit)
- Try yoga with wife at least once
- Have honest conversation with self about what I actually want

**L1 (Target):**
- All of L0
- Try yoga twice (or yoga once + calisthenics once)
- End the week with clarity on direction

**L2 (Stretch):**
- All of L1
- Start researching structured program for chosen direction
- Feel excited (not obligated) about next phase

**L3 (Exceptional):**
- All of L2
- Begin new practice immediately (don't overthink it)
- Wife and I find a couple activity we both enjoy

## Key Questions to Answer This Week

1. **Does yoga actually interest me?** (Not "should I do it" - but "do I WANT to?")
2. **Is calisthenics compelling enough to learn?**
3. **Am I chasing MORE (10K) or chasing SUSTAINABLE?**
4. **What would make me excited to keep moving for the next 20 years?**

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Decision paralysis**
- Mitigation: Set deadline (end of Week 9) to pick direction
- Can always adjust later, but need *a* direction

**Risk 2: Losing running habit while exploring**
- Mitigation: 3 runs this week non-negotiable (maintain base)

**Risk 3: Doing yoga "for wife" instead of "for me"**
- Mitigation: After first yoga session, honest self-check: "Did I enjoy that? Would I do it alone?"

**Risk 4: Overthinking instead of experimenting**
- Mitigation: Try things, don't just research them
- One yoga session > 10 hours of reading about yoga

## Reflection

**Eight weeks ago I couldn't run for 5 minutes.**
**Last week I ran 3.2 miles without stopping.**
**This week I'm figuring out what comes next.**

That's progress. Not just physical - but in how I think about my body, my capabilities, my future.

The goal isn't to "finish" - it's to keep going. Sustainably. Joyfully. For decades.

This week is about finding what that looks like.

**Next week:** Make a decision, commit to a direction, start the next chapter.
