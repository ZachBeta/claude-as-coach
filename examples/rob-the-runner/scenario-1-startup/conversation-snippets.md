# Conversation Snippets - Scenario 1: Getting Started

**Use these snippets during the demo to simulate Rob's first day using Claude-as-Coach.**

Paste these one at a time into the conversation, letting Claude respond between each one.

## Project Setup Response

**Use this when Claude asks about your focus area:**

```
Health & Fitness - I want to do a couch-to-5K running program.

I'm 39, work as an accountant, and realized I'm way more out of shape than I thought. Last weekend I was playing tag with my kids (6 and 8) and had to sit down after 10 minutes while they wanted to keep going.

That was a wake-up call. I want to be able to keep up with my kids. The 5K is just a milestone - the real goal is not being the winded dad on the sidelines.

I've heard couch-to-5K programs are about 8 weeks, but I don't really know where to start. Can you help me figure out a plan?
```

## Snippet 1: Ask for Plan Details

**After Claude provides initial guidance, ask for specifics:**

```
This sounds doable. Can you give me the week-by-week breakdown? I want to know exactly what I'm signing up for.

Also - when should I run? Morning before work? Evening? I'm not sure what works best for beginners.
```

## Snippet 2: After First Run (Morning)

**After Claude gives the plan, paste this as Rob reporting back:**

```
Just finished Day 1. "Finished" is generous - I survived it.

Did the plan you gave me: 5 min warmup walk, then 8 rounds of run 1 min / walk 2 min.

Honest report:
- First 1-minute run: okay, I can do this
- Third interval: breathing hard, questioning life choices
- Fifth interval: had to stop 10 seconds early
- Eighth interval: somehow finished but my legs felt like jelly

Total time: about 29 minutes
How I feel: 3/10. My calves are on fire. My shins hurt. Even my lungs feel weird.

But I did it. Day 1 is done.
```

## Snippet 3: Midday Reflection

```
Sitting at my desk thinking about this morning. I'm 39 years old and I couldn't run for ONE MINUTE without gasping.

When did I get this out of shape? I used to play pickup basketball in my 20s. Now I'm the dad who can't keep up with elementary schoolers.

The fact that I have 7 more weeks of this is terrifying. But also... I finished today. That's something.
```

## Snippet 4: Evening Check-in

```
Wife asked how my first run went. I told her it was rough.

She said: "That's normal. Just try it for two weeks before you decide anything."

She's right. I signed up for 8 weeks. It's been one day. One terrible day, but one day.

Next run is Friday according to the plan. I'm already dreading it.

Sleep plan: Going to try for 7+ hours tonight. I read somewhere that recovery matters.

Did I mention my calves still hurt? Because they do.
```

## After All Snippets

Say: **"daily summary"**

Claude should:
1. Verify the current date
2. Ask which date we're summarizing (today)
3. Ask for context tag (suggest "W1-D1")
4. Generate structured summary with:
   - TL;DR
   - Key Numbers (time, intervals completed, effort level)
   - Timeline (plan created → first run → reflection → evening)
   - Insights
   - Tomorrow's Focus

---

## Expected Key Insights in Summary

The AI should identify:
- **Coaching value:** Claude provided the plan Rob is following
- **Physical baseline:** 1-minute run intervals are hard, had to stop early on one
- **Completion:** Finished all 8 intervals despite struggling
- **Motivation clarity:** Kids, not the 5K itself, are the real goal
- **Support system:** Wife's encouragement ("try for two weeks")
- **Mindset:** Day 1 done - too early to judge the whole program

---

## Optional: Follow-up Questions

If Claude asks clarifying questions, you can answer:
- **Weight:** "About 203 lbs, I think. Haven't weighed myself in a while."
- **Heart rate:** "Don't know, I don't have a fitness watch."
- **Previous exercise:** "Nothing regular. Used to play basketball years ago."
- **Time of run:** "6:15am, before the kids woke up."
- **Diet:** "Standard office worker diet. Not great, not terrible."
