# Conversation Snippets - Scenario 1: Getting Started

**Use these snippets during the demo to simulate Rob's first day using Claude-as-Coach.**

Paste these one at a time into the conversation, reacting naturally between each one.

## Snippet 1: Morning (After First Run)

```
Just finished my first run. "Run" is generous - it was more like shuffling with occasional walking.

The couch-to-5K app said: Walk 2 min / Run 1 min x 8 reps. I made it through all 8 reps but barely.

After just the first 1-minute run interval I was already breathing hard. By the third interval I wasn't sure I'd make it. My calves are on fire. My shins hurt. Even my lungs feel weird.

Total time: about 24 minutes (including warmup walk)
Distance: maybe 1.5 miles? The app doesn't track distance, just time.
How I feel: 3/10. Everything hurts.
```

## Snippet 2: Midday Reflection

```
Sitting at my desk thinking about this morning. I'm 39 years old and I couldn't run for ONE MINUTE without gasping.

The realization that got me here: Playing tag with my kids (6 and 8) last weekend, I was winded after 10 minutes. They wanted to keep going. I needed to sit down.

When did I get this out of shape? I used to play pickup basketball in my 20s. Now I'm the dad who can't keep up with elementary schoolers.

I want to be able to play with my kids without needing to rest. That's the goal. The 5K is just the milestone.

## Snippet 3: Evening

```
Wife asked how my first run went. I told her it was rough.

She said: "That's normal. Just try it for two weeks before you decide anything."

She's right. I signed up for 8 weeks. It's been one day. One terrible day, but one day.

Tomorrow is a rest day (the program is Mon/Wed/Fri). I'm already dreading Wednesday.

Sleep plan: Try to get 7+ hours. Apparently recovery matters for this running thing.

Did I mention my calves still hurt? Because they do.

## After Pasting All Snippets

Say: **"daily summary"**

Claude should:
1. Verify the current date
2. Ask which date we're summarizing (today)
3. Generate structured Summary-W1-D1.md with:
   - TL;DR
   - Key Numbers (distance, time, effort level)
   - Timeline
   - Insights
   - Tomorrow's Focus

---

## Expected Key Insights in Summary

The AI should identify:
- **Physical baseline:** 1-minute run intervals are hard, everything hurts
- **Motivation clarity:** Kids, not the 5K itself, are the real goal
- **Support system:** Wife's encouragement ("try for two weeks")
- **Mindset:** Day 1 is just day 1 - too early to judge

---

## Optional: Follow-up Questions

If Claude asks clarifying questions, you can answer:
- **Weight:** "About 203 lbs, I think. Haven't weighed myself in a while."
- **Heart rate:** "Don't know, I don't have a fitness watch."
- **Previous exercise:** "Nothing regular. Used to play basketball years ago."
- **Diet:** "Standard office worker diet. Not great, not terrible."
