# Summary-2025-12-05-Friday-W4-D5

**Date:** Friday, December 5, 2025
**Context:** Week 4, Day 5 - THE 10-MINUTE RUN

## TL;DR

I ran for 10 minutes straight. No walking. No stopping. TEN MINUTES. Four weeks ago I couldn't run for ONE minute without gasping. Today I ran 10 minutes and finished feeling strong. This is the moment the program clicked. Weight check: 199 lbs - broke below 200 for the first time in 2 years.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Run duration** | 10 min continuous | NO WALK BREAKS |
| **Total workout** | ~20 min | Warmup + run + cooldown |
| **Distance** | ~1.0 mi | Just the run portion |
| **Pace** | ~10:00/mi | Comfortable, not racing |
| **Heart rate peak** | ~165 bpm | Estimated, no watch |
| **Effort** | 7/10 | Hard but manageable |
| **Morning weight** | 199 lbs | First time below 200! |
| **Sleep** | 7.5 hrs | Good recovery |

## Timeline

**6:30 AM** - Alarm
- Actually excited to run today
- The 10-minute continuous is the goal
- Felt ready

**6:45 AM** - Warmup
- Extended to 8 minutes (nervous energy)
- Extra calf stretches
- Deep breaths, mental prep

**6:53 AM** - Run begins
- Started SLOW (learned from past)
- "Just get through minute 1, then minute 2"
- Broke it into mental chunks

**6:56 AM** - Minute 3
- Finding rhythm
- Breathing settling
- "Okay, I can do this"

**6:59 AM** - Minute 6
- Halfway point
- Legs starting to feel it
- Told myself: "You've never quit this far in"

**7:02 AM** - Minute 9
- The hard part
- Counting down: 60 seconds left
- Everything saying "stop"
- Kept going

**7:03 AM** - MINUTE 10 COMPLETE
- Stopped my watch
- Stood there, hands on knees
- Breathing hard, grinning
- "Holy shit. I did it."

**7:05 AM** - Cooldown walk
- 5 minutes walking home
- Legs wobbly but good
- Replaying the run in my head

**7:15 AM** - Weigh-in

- First time below 200 in 2 years
- Perfect day

**8:00 AM** - Work
- Told a colleague about the run
- First time I've voluntarily talked about running
- Energy high all morning

**6:00 PM** - Dinner
- Told wife about the 10 minutes
- She said: "See? I told you to try for 2 weeks."
- Kids asked if I'm a runner now
- "I'm working on it."

## What Worked

**Slow Start:**
- First 3 minutes at easy pace
- Gave body time to warm up
- Had gas left for the end

**Mental Chunking:**
- "Just get to minute 3" → then minute 6 → then minute 9
- Never focused on "10 minutes" as a whole
- Smaller targets, sequential wins

**Trust the Program:**
- Week 1: 1 minute felt impossible
- Week 2: 2 minutes was hard
- Week 3: 3 minutes was challenging
- Week 4: 10 minutes was... achievable
- Progressive overload works

## What Didn't Work

**Recovery Needed:**
- Legs are tired now
- Tomorrow (Saturday) needs to be easy
- Don't want to undo the win

**Hydration Slipped:**
- So focused on the run, forgot water last night
- Slight headache during minutes 7-8
- Need to re-commit

## Insights

**The 10-minute threshold:**
- Not just a physical milestone
- Mental milestone: "I can do this"
- Evidence that the program works
- Everything from here is building on this

**Weight and running:**
- 4 lbs lost without crazy dieting
- Running 3x/week + slightly better eating
- Body composition shifting
- More to come

**Identity shift:**
- Before: "I'm not a runner"
- Now: "I'm becoming a runner"
- Not there yet, but trajectory is clear

## Tomorrow (Saturday)

**Recovery day:**
- Light walk only (10-15 min)
- Foam rolling if available
- Hydrate well
- Early to bed

**Week 5 preview:**
- Program: 15-minute continuous runs
- Mental prep: "If I can do 10, I can do 15"
- Monday is Day 1 of Month 2

## Looking Ahead

**Month 1 complete:**
- 12 runs done
- 10-minute milestone achieved
- 4 lbs lost
- Foundation built

**Month 2 (Weeks 5-8):**
- Week 5: 15-minute runs
- Week 6: 20-minute runs
- Week 7: 25-minute runs
- Week 8: 30-minute runs (5K GOAL!)

**The finish line is visible now.**

---

**Day 12 of 24 runs. Halfway point. Milestone achieved.**

**Week 1: 1 minute → Week 4: 10 minutes. This is what consistency looks like.**
