# Weekly-Retro-2025-12-01-to-7-W4

**Week:** 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-07, 2025 (Week 4 of 8)
**Program Phase:** Milestone - 10-minute continuous run!
**Runs Completed:** 3/3

## TL;DR

THE MILESTONE WEEK. Ran 10 minutes continuously on Day 5. TEN MINUTES. Four weeks ago I couldn't run ONE minute. Weight down 4 lbs (203→199). The program works. The consistency pays off. I'm not a runner yet, but I'm becoming one.

## What Worked (Roses)

### 10-Minute Continuous Run (Day 5)
- The big one. No walk breaks. No stopping.
- Started conservative, found a rhythm
- Last 2 minutes were hard but not impossible
- Finished feeling strong
- First time I thought: "I might actually finish this program"

### 5-Minute Intervals (Days 1 & 3)
- W90sR5m x 3 format
- Each 5-minute block felt manageable
- Good preparation for the 10-minute run

### Weight Loss
- Started program: 203 lbs
- Week 4 weigh-in: 199 lbs
- 4 lbs down without aggressive dieting
- Just running + slightly better eating

### Habit Formation
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday runs are automatic now
- Alarm goes off → gear on → out the door
- Less internal debate, more execution

## What Didn't Work (Thorns)

### Post-10-Minute Recovery
- Legs were tired Saturday/Sunday
- Maybe pushed too hard for the milestone?
- Need to respect recovery

### Work Stress Still Present
- Busy season intensifying
- Thursday night almost skipped prep
- Managed, but it's a real risk factor

### Hydration Regression
- Focused so much on running, forgot water habits
- Day 3: mild headache again
- Need to re-systematize

## Week-over-Week Comparison

| Metric | Week 3 | Week 4 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Runs completed | 3/3 | 3/3 | = Same |
| Longest run (min) | 3 | 10 | ↑↑ Huge! |
| Weight (lbs) | 201 | 199 | ↓ Good |
| Avg effort | 6.7/10 | 6.3/10 | ↓ Easier |
| Sleep avg | 7.5 hrs | 7.5 hrs | = Same |
| Morning energy | 6/10 | 7/10 | ↑ Better |

**Progress:** Exponential. 3-min → 10-min in one week. Body ready for more.

## Experiments for Week 5

### 1. Recovery Focus
- Light walks on rest days (tested, works)
- Foam rolling Saturday evening
- Extra sleep Sunday night

### 2. Hydration Re-commitment
- Water bottle always visible
- 8oz with every meal
- Track it for one week

### 3. 15-Minute Runs (Week 5)
- Program jumps to 15-min continuous
- Mental prep: "If I can do 10, I can do 15"
- Focus on pace, not speed

## Metrics

| Metric | Day 1 | Day 3 | Day 5 | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Effort (1-10) | 6 | 6 | 7 | Stable |
| Soreness (1-10) | 2 | 2 | 3 | Slight ↑ |
| Energy post-run | 7 | 7 | 8 | ↑ Good |
| Sleep (hrs) | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | Stable |
| Mood after | 8 | 8 | 9 | ↑ Great |
