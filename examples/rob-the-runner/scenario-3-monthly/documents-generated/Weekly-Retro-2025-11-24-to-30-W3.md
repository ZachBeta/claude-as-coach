# Weekly-Retro-2025-11-24-to-30-W3

**Week:** 2025-11-24 to 2025-11-30, 2025 (Week 3 of 8)
**Program Phase:** Progression - Longer intervals (W90sR3m)
**Runs Completed:** 3/3

## TL;DR

Breakthrough week. First 3-minute continuous runs - and I did it. Three times. The physical adaptation is visible now: less soreness, easier breathing, more energy. Mental shift too: from "Can I do this?" to "I AM doing this." Week 3 is where it started feeling possible.

## What Worked (Roses)

### 3-Minute Intervals
- First time running more than 2 minutes
- Day 1: scared, but finished all 5 intervals
- Day 3: 3 minutes started to feel "normal"
- Day 5: could have gone longer (but didn't, trust the program)

### Post-Run Nutrition
- Banana + peanut butter after each run
- Afternoon energy much better
- No 2pm crash this week

### Sunday Night Routine
- Screens off at 9pm Sunday
- Clothes laid out, alarm across room
- Zero oversleeping incidents
- Starting Week 4 fresh

### Soreness Dramatically Reduced
- Week 1: Everything hurt constantly
- Week 3: Mild tightness after runs, nothing more
- Body has adapted to the load

## What Didn't Work (Thorns)

### Work Stress Interference
- Busy season starting at the firm
- Thursday: almost skipped Day 5 prep
- Managed it, but felt the pull

### Pacing Still Variable
- First interval: start too fast
- Last interval: stronger finish
- Need more even pacing

### Weekend Activity Gap
- Rest days are very sedentary
- Sunday evening feels stiff
- Maybe add light walking?

## Week-over-Week Comparison

| Metric | Week 2 | Week 3 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Runs completed | 3/3 | 3/3 | = Same |
| Avg effort | 7.3/10 | 6.7/10 | ↓ Easier |
| Avg soreness | 3.0/10 | 2.0/10 | ↓ Better |
| Sleep avg | 7.2 hrs | 7.5 hrs | ↑ Improving |
| Energy (post-run 2pm) | 5/10 | 7/10 | ↑ Much better |

**Progress:** Noticeable physical improvement. Program working as designed.

## Experiments for Week 4

### 1. Pacing Focus
- First interval: deliberately slow start
- Watch the clock, not the feeling
- See if I finish stronger

### 2. Rest Day Walks
- 10-minute walk Saturday
- 10-minute walk Sunday
- Test: less stiffness Monday morning?

### 3. Work Stress Protocol
- If work is overwhelming, run anyway
- Shorter warmup if needed, but run
- Track: does running help work stress?

## Metrics

| Metric | Day 1 | Day 3 | Day 5 | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Effort (1-10) | 7 | 7 | 6 | ↓ Getting easier |
| Soreness (1-10) | 2 | 2 | 2 | Stable (low) |
| Energy post-run | 7 | 7 | 8 | ↑ Good |
| Sleep (hrs) | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | Stable |
| Mood after | 7 | 8 | 8 | ↑ Good |

## Retro-Retro (Process Check)

**What's working:**
- Weekly comparison shows clear progress
- Experiments are leading to real changes
- Format feels right

**This week's process win:**
- Noticed work stress as a risk factor
- Addressed it proactively (protocol)
- This is the system working

## Key Insight

**The mental shift happened:**

Week 1: "I'm trying to become a runner"
Week 2: "I'm following a running program"
Week 3: "I AM doing this"

The identity is shifting. Not a runner yet, but no longer a non-runner. Somewhere in between. And that's progress.

**3-minute runs used to seem impossible:**
- Week 1: 1-minute runs nearly killed me
- Week 3: 3-minute runs are challenging but doable
- Pattern: what seems impossible becomes possible with consistency

## Gratitude

### For Day 1 of Week 3
- First 3-minute run ever
- Scary before, proud after
- Milestone moment

### For My Body
- Adapting faster than expected
- Soreness almost gone
- Cardiovascular improvement visible

### For the Program
- Gradual progression works
- I just have to follow it
- Trust the process

### For Halfway Point
- 3 weeks down, 5 to go
- Past the hump
- Momentum building

**Week 3 Summary: Breakthrough. 3-minute runs achieved. Identity shifting. Halfway there.**
