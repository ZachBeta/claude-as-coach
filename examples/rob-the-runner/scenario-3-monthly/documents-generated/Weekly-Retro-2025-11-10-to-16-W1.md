# Weekly-Retro-2025-11-10-to-16-W1

**Week:** 2025-11-10 to 2025-11-16, 2025 (Week 1 of 8)
**Program Phase:** Foundation - Walk/run intervals (W2R1)
**Runs Completed:** 3/3

## TL;DR

Survived the hardest week. Almost quit on Day 3 (shin pain crisis) but pushed through. Day 5 was noticeably easier than Day 1 - first evidence that body adapts. Getting fitted for proper running shoes this weekend. Key learning: showing up > everything else.

## What Worked (Roses)

### Showing Up
- 3 runs scheduled, 3 runs completed
- Day 3: wanted to quit, modified instead
- Day 5: finished all intervals without modification
- Perfect attendance matters more than perfect performance

### Wife's Support
- "Just try it for two weeks" grounded me
- Reframe on Day 3: "You didn't quit and come home"
- External accountability without pressure

### Kids as Motivation
- "Did you run today, Dad?" keeps me honest
- Their simple pride after Day 5 run
- The real goal (play with them) stayed visible

### Following the Program
- Didn't try to modify or "push harder"
- App says W2R1 x 8, I did W2R1 x 8
- Structure removes decision fatigue

## What Didn't Work (Thorns)

### Running Shoes
- Old sneakers aren't meant for running
- Direct contributor to shin pain
- Scheduled shoe fitting for Saturday

### Hydration
- Inconsistent water intake
- Headache during Day 1 run
- Need system, not just intention

### Sleep
- 6.5 hours Day 1, gradually improved
- Day 5 (7.5 hrs) was noticeably better
- Sleep affects run quality and recovery

### Mental Game
- "I can't do this" loop was loud on Day 3
- Almost won
- Need better toolkit for hard moments

## Week-over-Week Comparison

**N/A** - First week baseline established.

**Next week comparison points:**
- Can I complete all runs without modification?
- Will shin pain improve with warmup routine?
- Will 2-minute run intervals feel different?

## Experiments for Week 2

### 1. Extended Warmup
- Add 2 extra minutes of stretching
- Specific shin/calf stretches
- See if it reduces shin pain

### 2. Hydration System
- Water bottle on nightstand
- 16oz before bed rule
- 8oz morning before run

### 3. Earlier Bedtime
- Target 10:00 PM (was 10:30-11:00)
- Goal: 7.5+ hours sleep
- See if it affects morning energy

## Metrics

| Metric | Day 1 | Day 3 | Day 5 | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Effort (1-10) | 9 | 10 | 7 | ↓ Improving |
| Shin pain (1-10) | 3 | 7 | 4 | Variable |
| Energy post-run | 3 | 4 | 6 | ↑ Improving |
| Sleep (hrs) | 6.5 | 7 | 7.5 | ↑ Improving |
| Mood after | 5 | 4 | 7 | ↑ Improving |

## Retro-Retro (Process Check)

**What's working about reflection:**
- Writing summaries after each run helps process
- Seeing Day 1 vs Day 5 contrast is motivating
- Patterns visible that I wouldn't notice otherwise

**What to adjust:**
- Maybe track hydration more explicitly
- Add "morning weight" as metric?
- Keep format simple for now

## Gratitude

### For Day 3
- It was the worst day
- But I didn't quit
- Everything after is built on that choice

### For Wife
- Patient, supportive, practical
- Doesn't push, just encourages
- "Try it for two weeks" was perfect

### For My Body
- 39, sedentary, overweight
- Still capable of adaptation
- Day 5 proved body responds to training

### For Week 1
- The hardest week is done
- If I can survive this, I can finish
- 1 week down, 7 to go

**Week 1 Summary: Foundation established. Hardest part complete. Moving forward.**
