# Summary-{{W1_D3_DATE}}-{{W1_D3_DAY}}-W1-D3

**Date:** {{W1_D3_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 1, Day 3 (Run 2) - Second run, shin pain almost made me quit

## TL;DR

Second run of the program. Shin pain hit hard during interval 3 and I almost quit. Finished anyway but was seriously questioning whether this was a good idea. The physical pain was bad, but the mental battle was worse. "I'm 39 and I can't do this basic thing" played on loop. Wife talked me off the ledge tonight. Ordered new running shoes - apparently that helps with shin splints.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Workout** | W2R1 x 8 | Same as Monday |
| **Total time** | ~25 min | Slightly slower (pain) |
| **Distance** | ~1.4 mi | Shorter stride due to shins |
| **Effort** | 10/10 | Hardest workout of my life |
| **Shin pain** | 7/10 | Sharp pain, both legs |
| **Sleep last night** | 7 hrs | Better than Monday |

## Timeline

**6:45 AM** - Alarm
- Calves still sore from Monday
- Shins feel... tight?
- Out of bed anyway

**7:00 AM** - Warmup walk
- Shins protesting during walk
- Should have stretched more
- Ignored warning signs

**7:05 AM** - Interval 1
- Okay, not great but okay
- Shins uncomfortable but manageable

**7:08 AM** - Interval 2
- Breathing hard (expected)
- Shin pain increasing
- Tried to adjust stride

**7:11 AM** - Interval 3 (crisis point)
- Sharp pain in both shins
- Stopped mid-interval
- Stood there thinking "I can't do this"
- 30 seconds of wanting to quit
- Started walking instead of running
- Finished the interval walking

**7:14 AM - 7:28 AM** - Intervals 4-8
- Modified: ran when I could, walked when I couldn't
- Some intervals were mostly walking
- Finished all 8, but barely counts as "running"
- Mental loop: "You can't even run 1 minute"

**7:30 AM** - Cooldown
- Limped home
- Shins throbbing
- Feeling like a failure

**8:00 AM - 5:00 PM** - Work
- Hard to focus
- Kept thinking about the run
- Googled "shin splints couch to 5K"
- Apparently common in beginners
- Apparently need better shoes

**6:00 PM** - Dinner conversation
- Told wife about the shin pain
- She said: "Did you finish the workout?"
- "Sort of. Mostly walked."
- "But you didn't quit and come home?"
- "No..."
- "Then you're still in the program."

**7:30 PM** - Ordered running shoes
- Went to Fleet Feet website (local running store)
- Scheduled fitting appointment for Saturday
- $120-150 for proper shoes
- Worth it if it fixes the shin pain

**9:00 PM** - Evening reflection
- Kids asked if I ran today
- "Yeah, buddy. It was hard."
- 6-year-old: "But you did it?"
- "Yeah. I did it."

## What Worked

**Not quitting:**
- I wanted to quit during interval 3
- I didn't
- Modified yes, quit no
- That distinction matters

**Asking for help:**
- Googled the problem
- Ordered proper shoes
- Taking the shin pain seriously

**Wife's reframe:**
- "You didn't quit and come home"
- She's right
- Finishing (even modified) > not starting

## What Didn't Work

**Shoes:**
- Running in old sneakers
- Not designed for running
- Contributing to shin pain

**Ignoring warning signs:**
- Shins felt tight during warmup
- Should have done more stretching
- Or at least gone slower

**Mental game:**
- "I can't do this" loop was loud
- Almost won
- Need better mental toolkit

## Insights

**Shin splints are normal:**
- Every couch-to-5K forum mentions them
- Usually: bad shoes + too much too soon
- Usually: goes away with proper gear and gradual progression
- Not a sign I'm "broken"

**The real test:**
- Day 1 was hard physically
- Day 3 was hard mentally
- Wanting to quit and not quitting are different
- I wanted to quit. I didn't quit.

**Modification isn't failure:**
- Ran some, walked some
- Still moved for 25 minutes
- Still did the workout
- Progress isn't linear

**Support system matters:**
- Wife's question cut through the noise
- Kids' simple pride helped
- Doing this alone would be harder

## Tomorrow

**Rest day (Thursday):**
- Ice the shins (15 min on/off)
- Gentle stretching
- Walk only if shins feel okay
- Early to bed

**Friday run:**
- Same workout (W2R1 x 8)
- Go even slower if needed
- Focus on finishing, not speed
- New shoes won't arrive until next week, so be careful

**Shoe fitting Saturday:**
- Get properly fitted
- Accept the cost
- View as investment in not-quitting

---

**Day 3 of 56. Almost quit. Didn't.**
