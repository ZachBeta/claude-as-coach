# Summary-{{W1_D5_DATE}}-{{W1_D5_DAY}}-W1-D5

**Date:** {{W1_D5_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 1, Day 5 (Run 3) - End of first week, made it through!

## TL;DR

Third and final run of Week 1. Something shifted - it was still hard, but not as hard as Wednesday. Completed all 8 intervals without stopping or modifying. Shins were uncomfortable but not crisis-level. First workout that felt like "I might actually be able to do this." Week 1 complete: 3 runs done, 0 quits. Getting fitted for proper shoes tomorrow.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Workout** | W2R1 x 8 | All intervals completed as prescribed! |
| **Total time** | ~24 min | Back to normal pace |
| **Distance** | ~1.6 mi | Slightly further than Mon |
| **Effort** | 7/10 | Hard but manageable |
| **Shin pain** | 4/10 | Present but not alarming |
| **Sleep last night** | 7.5 hrs | Best of the week |
| **Week 1 runs** | 3/3 | 100% completion |

## Timeline

**6:45 AM** - Alarm
- Less dread than Monday/Wednesday
- Shins feel... okay?
- Cautiously optimistic

**7:00 AM** - Warmup walk + stretches
- Extra time on calf stretches
- Shin stretches (found YouTube tutorial)
- 7 minutes instead of usual 5

**7:07 AM** - Interval 1
- Started slow (learned from Wednesday)
- Felt okay
- Breathing hard but controlled

**7:10 AM** - Interval 2
- Slight shin discomfort
- Not pain, just awareness
- Kept going

**7:13 AM - 7:27 AM** - Intervals 3-8
- The intervals got easier???
- Or at least, I got used to them
- Interval 6: first time I felt "in a rhythm"
- Interval 8: finished strong (relatively)

**7:30 AM** - Cooldown
- Walked home without limping
- Tired but not destroyed
- Thought: "I did it. All three this week."

**8:00 AM** - Work
- Energy noticeably better than Wednesday
- Less mental fog
- Productive morning

**12:00 PM** - Lunch walk
- Decided to walk outside
- 10 minutes around the block
- Felt good, not forced

**6:00 PM** - Dinner
- Wife: "How was the run?"
- "Better. Actually better."
- Kids high-fived me

**8:00 PM** - Week 1 reflection
- 3 runs completed
- 1 near-quit (Wednesday), but didn't
- First week: survived
- Tomorrow: shoe fitting

## What Worked

**Proper warmup:**
- Extra stretching time paid off
- Shins didn't flare up like Wednesday
- Will make this standard

**Slower start:**
- Interval 1 was deliberately slow
- Gave body time to adjust
- Less shock to the system

**Sleep:**
- 7.5 hours made a difference
- Less fatigue during the run
- Will prioritize sleep

**"Just finish" mindset:**
- Not trying to be fast
- Not trying to impress anyone
- Just complete the intervals
- Took pressure off

## What Didn't Work

**Still no proper shoes:**
- Running in old sneakers
- Shin pain is manageable but present
- Saturday fitting can't come soon enough

**Hydration still inconsistent:**
- Forgot to drink water before bed Thursday
- Slightly dehydrated this morning
- Need a system (not just intention)

## Insights

**Day 5 was easier than Day 1:**
- Same workout (W2R1 x 8)
- But body is already adapting
- 4 days of change is visible
- This is encouraging

**The Wednesday crisis matters:**
- Almost quit on Day 3
- Didn't quit
- Day 5 was the reward for not quitting
- Pattern: show up → adapt → improve

**Small wins compound:**
- Day 1: survived
- Day 3: didn't quit
- Day 5: completed without modification
- Each day built on the last

**Week 1 lesson:**
- Starting is the hardest part
- Not because the body can't do it
- Because the mind doesn't believe yet
- Body adapted in 5 days
- Mind is catching up

## Tomorrow (Saturday)

**Shoe fitting at Fleet Feet:**
- 10:00 AM appointment
- Get gait analysis
- Buy proper running shoes
- Accept the $120-150 cost

**Rest day activities:**
- Light walk if weather's nice
- Foam rolling (need to buy one?)
- Stretch session in evening

## Week 2 Preview

**Program progression:**
- Week 2: W2R2 x 6 (Walk 2 min / Run 2 min, 6 reps)
- Double the run intervals!
- Slightly fewer reps
- Total run time increases

**Focus:**
- New shoes should help shin pain
- Maintain warmup routine
- Don't increase pace, just complete intervals
- Trust the program

**Schedule:**
- Monday: W2 Run 1
- Wednesday: W2 Run 2
- Friday: W2 Run 3

---

**Week 1 complete: 3/3 runs. The hardest part is over.**

**"If you can survive Weeks 1-2, you can finish the program."**
