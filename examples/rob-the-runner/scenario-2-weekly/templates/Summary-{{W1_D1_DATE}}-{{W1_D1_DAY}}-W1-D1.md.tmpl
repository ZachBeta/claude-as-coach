# Summary-{{W1_D1_DATE}}-{{W1_D1_DAY}}-W1-D1

**Date:** {{W1_D1_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 1, Day 1 - First ever run in couch-to-5K program

## TL;DR

First run of the couch-to-5K program. "Run" is generous - more like shuffling with walking breaks. Completed all 8 intervals (Walk 2 min / Run 1 min x 8) but barely. Everything hurts. Calves, shins, quads, lungs - all protesting. Reality check: I'm 39 and can't run 1 minute without gasping. But I finished. That's something.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Workout** | W2R1 x 8 | Walk 2 min / Run 1 min, 8 reps |
| **Total time** | ~24 min | Including warmup walk |
| **Distance** | ~1.5 mi | Estimated (app tracks time only) |
| **Effort** | 9/10 | Way harder than expected |
| **Energy post** | 3/10 | Exhausted |
| **Sleep last night** | 6.5 hrs | Need more |

## Timeline

**6:45 AM** - Alarm went off
- Immediately regretted signing up for this
- Internal debate: "Do I really have to?"
- Got up anyway (wife would ask)

**7:00 AM** - Out the door
- Light warmup walk (5 min)
- Dynamic stretches (feeling stiff)

**7:05 AM** - First run interval begins
- 1 minute of "running"
- By 45 seconds: already breathing hard
- Thought: "This is going to be a long 8 weeks"

**7:08 AM - 7:25 AM** - Remaining 7 intervals
- Each 1-minute run felt longer than the last
- Walk breaks weren't enough recovery
- By interval 5: questioning all life choices
- Finished all 8 (barely)

**7:30 AM** - Cooldown
- 5-minute walk back home
- Calves screaming
- Shins aching (is this shin splints?)

**8:00 AM** - Showered, at desk
- Sitting hurts
- Drinking water like crazy

**12:30 PM** - Lunch break reflection
- Remembered why I'm doing this: kids in the backyard
- Last weekend, winded after 10 min of tag
- That's the real goal: keep up with them

**6:00 PM** - Evening
- Wife asked how it went
- "Rough. Really rough."
- She said: "Just try it for two weeks"
- She's right. One day doesn't define anything.

**9:30 PM** - Before bed
- Calves still sore
- Set alarm for Wednesday (rest day tomorrow!)
- Already dreading Day 2

## What Worked

**Showing up:**
- Easiest thing to do was stay in bed
- Got up anyway
- That's the only win that matters today

**Following the program:**
- App told me what to do
- I did it
- Didn't try to modify or "push harder"
- Just followed the intervals

**Wife's support:**
- "Try it for two weeks"
- Simple advice, but grounding
- External accountability helps

## What Didn't Work

**Physical readiness:**
- More out of shape than I thought
- 1-minute run intervals felt impossible
- Need to accept: this is my starting point

**Hydration:**
- Didn't drink enough water yesterday
- Slight headache during workout
- Need system for pre-run hydration

**Sleep:**
- 6.5 hours isn't enough
- Body needs recovery time
- Need to get to bed earlier

## Insights

**Starting point reality check:**
- I'm 39, sedentary, 25 lbs overweight
- Of course 1-minute runs are hard
- This isn't failure, this is baseline

**The real goal emerged:**
- Signed up for couch-to-5K
- But the REAL goal: play with my kids without dying
- The 5K is a milestone, not the destination

**Mental vs physical:**
- The physical challenge was hard
- But the mental challenge was harder
- Getting out of bed was the real battle

## Tomorrow

**Rest day protocols:**
- Stay hydrated
- Light walking if legs feel up to it
- Get 7+ hours sleep
- No guilt about not running

**Wednesday prep:**
- Same workout: W2R1 x 8
- Lay out clothes Tuesday night
- Banana 30 min before (less empty stomach)

**Mindset:**
- One day down
- That's progress
- Don't judge the program by Day 1

**Day 1 of 56. Survived.**
