# Rob the Runner - Demo Persona (Base Skills Only)

**This is synthetic demo data created for the December 12th, 2025 presentation.**

## About Rob

**Name:** Rob
**Age:** 39 (turning 40 in ~6 months)
**Profession:** Accountant at mid-size firm
**Starting Point:** Sedentary office worker, gained 25 lbs over 5 years, random aches and pains

**Motivation:** Playing tag with his kids (ages 6 and 8) in the backyard, got winded after 10 minutes. Realized: "When did I get this out of shape?" Approaching 40th birthday, wants to be the dad who can keep up with his kids.

**Goal:** Complete a 5K run using a structured 8-week couch-to-5K program

**Timeline:** October 7 - November 29, 2025 (8 weeks)

## Demo Purpose: Base Skills Only

**Key demonstration value:** Rob uses the **base skills WITHOUT custom personal extensions**.

This shows:
- ✅ The system works out-of-box with zero customization
- ✅ You don't need to create personal skills to get value
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry for new users
- ✅ Base skills provide solid structure and guidance

**Contrast with Alice example:**
- Alice (if referenced): Shows extensibility via custom personal skills
- Rob: Shows simplicity via base skills alone

## Fractal Compression Pattern

Rob's documents demonstrate the **daily → weekly → monthly rollup pattern**:

### Recent Data (Most Granular)
**Week 8 - November 25-29, 2025**
- `Summary-2025-11-25-Monday-W8-D1.md`
- `Summary-2025-11-27-Wednesday-W8-D2.md`
- `Summary-2025-11-29-Friday-W8-D3.md`

Shows: Day-to-day details, individual run metrics, immediate insights

### Mid-Range Data (Weekly Compression)
**Weeks 5-7 - November 4-24, 2025**
- `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-04-to-10-W5.md` (Week 5)
- `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-11-to-17-W6.md` (Week 6)
- `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-18-to-24-W7.md` (Week 7)

Shows: 21 days compressed into 3 weekly summaries

### Historical Data (Monthly Compression)
**Weeks 1-4 - October 7-31, 2025**
- `Monthly-Rollup-2025-10-October.md`

Shows: First 4 weeks compressed into single monthly summary

## Make-Change Algorithm Visualization

```
Most compressed:   [October Rollup] = Weeks 1-4 (28 days → 1 doc)
                         ↓
Medium compression: [Weekly Retros] = Weeks 5-7 (21 days → 3 docs)
                         ↓
Most granular:     [Daily Summaries] = Week 8 (3 days → 3 docs)
```

**Design principle:** System maintains detail where it matters most (recent activity), compresses historical data to reduce cognitive load and Claude context usage.

## Using This as a Template

**To adapt for your goals:**

1. **Use the same document structure** (base skills define this)
2. **Replace Rob's running metrics** with your domain:
   - Learning: Study hours, comprehension, topic mastery
   - Business: Revenue, customer calls, deep work hours
   - Creative: Word count, pieces completed, flow states
3. **Keep the fractal pattern:** Recent (daily) → Mid-range (weekly) → Historical (monthly)
4. **Start with base skills** - only create custom skills if you need them
