# Weekly-Retro-2025-11-10-to-16-W5

**Week:** November 10-16, 2025 (Week 5 of 8)
**Program phase:** Midpoint - Building continuous running endurance

## Week Summary

Midpoint of the couch-to-5K program. This week marked a shift: less walking, more continuous running. Hit all three scheduled runs (Monday/Wednesday/Friday). Biggest milestone: 15-minute continuous run without stopping. Sleep and hydration still inconsistent but improving. Work stress moderate (quarterly reports due), but didn't derail training.

**Key metrics:**
- Runs completed: 3 of 3
- Total distance: ~8 miles
- Average pace: ~12:00 min/mi
- Weight: 197 lbs (6 lbs down from start)
- Sleep average: 7.3 hours
- Missed workouts: 0

## What Worked This Week

**Consistency building:**
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule becoming automatic
- No longer debating "should I run today?" - just doing it
- Habit forming: laid out gear Sunday night for whole week

**Continuous running milestone:**
- Increased from 10-minute runs (Week 4) to 15-minute runs (Week 5)
- Body adapting faster than expected
- Mental barrier was bigger than physical - surprised myself

**Sleep improvement:**
- Average 7.3 hours (up from 6.8 in Week 4)
- Earlier bedtime on Sunday helped Monday run
- Noticing: good sleep = better runs, obvious pattern now

**Route variety:**
- Tried new route Wednesday (park loop vs neighborhood)
- More shade, softer surface (dirt path sections)
- Made running more interesting, less monotonous

**Recovery attention:**
- Foam rolled 4 days this week (vs 2 last week)
- Stretching post-run becoming non-negotiable
- Noticing less next-day soreness

## What Didn't Work This Week

**Wednesday run cut short:**
- Work emergency at 8:30 AM
- Had to cut run short (20 min instead of 30 min planned)
- Got 15-minute continuous run done, but missed cooldown
- Frustrated - external factors interfering

**Pre-run fueling inconsistency:**
- Monday: banana 30 min before (felt good)
- Wednesday: nothing (stomach felt off mid-run)
- Friday: banana 15 min before (felt too full)
- Need to find consistent timing

**Hydration still spotty:**
- Forgot to hydrate Tuesday night
- Wednesday run: headache at minute 10
- Need system (reminder? water bottle on nightstand?)

**Weekend rest felt excessive:**
- Saturday/Sunday: no activity besides normal life
- Sunday evening: felt tight and stiff
- Should add light activity on rest days

## Progress Toward Goal

**Program checkpoint:**
- Week 5 of 8 complete (62.5% done)
- Currently: 15-minute continuous runs
- Target by Week 8: 30+ minutes (5K distance)
- On track, progressing as designed

**Body adaptation:**
- Cardiovascular: definitely improving (less huffing/puffing)
- Muscular: legs adapting, less soreness than Weeks 1-3
- Weight: 6 lbs down (203 -> 197), steady 1 lb/week pace

**Mental game:**
- Confidence building: "I can do this" feeling stronger
- Still some doubt: "Can I really run 30 minutes straight?"
- But evidence says: yes, if I keep building progressively

**Habit formation:**
- Running 3x/week feels normal now
- Not fighting myself to get out the door
- Morning routine automatic: alarm -> clothes -> banana -> run

## Experiments to Try Next Week (Week 6)

**Experiment 1: Pre-run fueling timing**
- Test: Banana exactly 30 minutes before run (set timer)
- Hypothesis: Consistent timing = no stomach issues, stable energy
- Measure: How stomach feels during run, energy levels

**Experiment 2: Active recovery on rest days**
- Test: Add 20-minute walk on Saturday and/or Sunday
- Hypothesis: Light activity = less stiffness, maintain momentum
- Measure: How body feels on Monday morning run

**Experiment 3: Hydration system**
- Test: Water bottle on nightstand, drink before bed
- Hypothesis: Pre-hydrating prevents mid-run headaches
- Measure: Headache frequency during runs

## Challenges & Obstacles

**Work interference:**
- Wednesday emergency call cut run short
- Busy season approaching (tax season prep for accountants starts December)
- Need backup plan: can I run at lunch? Evening?

**Weather changing:**
- Temperatures dropping (58 degrees F mornings now)
- Need: better running shirt? Gloves?
- Don't want cold to be excuse to skip

**Mental milestones ahead:**
- Week 6: 20-minute continuous runs
- Week 7: 25-minute continuous runs
- Week 8: 30-minute continuous runs (5K!)
- Each feels intimidating even though I'm progressing fine

## Insights

**Progress is gradual, then suddenly obvious:**
- Day-to-day: small changes, hard to notice
- Week-to-week: clear pattern emerging
- This week I realized: I'm becoming a runner

**Consistency > intensity:**
- Not pushing for speed or long distances
- Just: show up, follow the plan, recover
- That's apparently enough

**The program structure removes decision fatigue:**
- I don't decide "how far today" or "how hard"
- Plan tells me, I execute
- Reduces mental barriers

**External factors (work, sleep) matter:**
- Can't isolate "just running"
- Sleep affects runs, runs affect energy, energy affects work
- It's all connected

**Midpoint is motivating:**
- Halfway through = can see finish line
- Also: can look back and see how far I've come
- Both backward and forward perspective helpful

## Gratitude

**For my body:**
- It's adapting. Not fighting me.
- Age 39 isn't too old to start

**For the plan:**
- Having structure helps so much
- Don't have to figure it out myself

**For small wins:**
- 15-minute continuous run = huge milestone
- Wouldn't have seemed possible Week 1

**For consistency:**
- Three runs this week, no excuses
- That's worth celebrating

## Next Week Preview (Week 6)

**Program plan:**
- 3 runs: Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- Target: 20-minute continuous runs
- Big jump from 15 min -> 20 min (33% increase)

**Focus areas:**
- Nail down pre-run fueling timing (30 min before, consistent)
- Add active recovery on weekend (light walks)
- Hydration system (water bottle on nightstand)

**Watch out for:**
- Work busy season starting
- Weather getting colder
- Mental resistance to 20-minute milestone

**Commitment:**
- Show up for all 3 runs
- Trust the program
- Celebrate the 20-minute milestone when I hit it
