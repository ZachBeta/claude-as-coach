# Weekly-Retro-2025-11-17-to-23-W6

**Week:** November 17-23, 2025 (Week 6 of 8)
**Program phase:** Advanced endurance building - 20-minute continuous runs

## Week Summary

Week 6 complete - hit the 20-minute continuous run milestone. All three runs completed successfully. Experiments from last week (fueling timing, active recovery, hydration) mostly paid off. Weather got colder (45-50 degrees F mornings), required gear adjustment. Work stress increased (busy season prep), but maintained training schedule. Felt a shift: running is part of my identity now, not something I'm "trying."

**Key metrics:**
- Runs completed: 3 of 3
- Total distance: ~9 miles
- Average pace: ~11:50 min/mi (slight improvement)
- Weight: 195 lbs (8 lbs down from start)
- Sleep average: 7.5 hours (improved from 7.3)
- Missed workouts: 0

## What Worked This Week

**20-minute continuous run milestone:**
- Wednesday: hit 20 minutes for first time
- Easier than expected (proof that progressive overload works)
- Mental barrier was the challenge, not physical capacity

**Fueling timing experiment (SUCCESS):**
- Banana exactly 30 minutes before run (set timer)
- All three runs: no stomach issues
- Energy stable throughout
- This is the pattern - keeping it

**Active recovery experiment (SUCCESS):**
- Saturday: 20-minute neighborhood walk
- Sunday: 25-minute walk with family
- Monday morning run: felt loose and ready (not stiff like last week)

**Hydration system (SUCCESS):**
- Water bottle on nightstand every night
- Drink before bed = no mid-run headaches this week
- Simple fix, big impact

**Cold weather adaptation:**
- Bought long-sleeve running shirt
- Wore it Friday (48 degrees F morning)
- Stayed warm, didn't overheat

**Pacing getting more intuitive:**
- Less thinking about "am I going too fast?"
- Body knows the comfortable pace now
- Average pace slightly faster (11:50 vs 12:00) without trying

## What Didn't Work This Week

**Monday motivation lag:**
- Felt resistance Monday morning (first time in weeks)
- Eventually got out the door, but took extra mental energy
- Why? Weekend was relaxing, hard to restart

**Friday run cut short (slightly):**
- Aimed for 22 minutes, stopped at 20
- Left knee felt "off" (not pain, just awareness)
- Erred on side of caution (good decision?)

**Weekend activity timing:**
- Saturday walk: 5 PM (after full day of errands)
- Sunday walk: 11 AM (mid-morning)
- Sunday timing felt better for Monday recovery
- Saturday timing felt like "one more thing to do"

**Work stress creeping:**
- Busy season prep (December tax deadlines)
- Longer work days = less evening time
- Morning runs protected so far, but feeling time crunch

## Progress Toward Goal

**Program checkpoint:**
- Week 6 of 8 complete (75% done)
- Currently: 20-minute continuous runs
- Target by Week 8: 30 minutes (5K distance)
- Two weeks left - finish line visible

**Body adaptation:**
- Cardiovascular: major improvement (20 min feels sustainable)
- Muscular: quads/calves noticeably stronger
- Weight: 8 lbs down (203 -> 195), steady progress
- Resting heart rate: dropped (measured Thursday morning: 68 bpm vs 74 Week 1)

**Mental game:**
- Identity shift happening: "I'm a runner" (not "I'm trying to run")
- Confidence high: Week 7 (25 min) and Week 8 (30 min) feel achievable
- Less internal resistance, more automatic execution

**Habit formation:**
- Running 3x/week completely habitual now
- Gear laid out Sunday night without thinking
- Morning routine automatic

## Experiments Results Summary

**From Week 5 experiments:**

| Experiment | Result | Keep? |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Banana 30 min before (exact timing) | No stomach issues, stable energy | YES - continue |
| Active recovery walks (weekends) | Less Monday stiffness, better run | YES - continue |
| Hydration (water before bed) | No headaches, felt better | YES - continue |

**All three experiments: SUCCESS**

## New Experiments for Week 7

**Experiment 1: Morning routine optimization**
- Current: Alarm -> dress -> banana -> wait 30 min -> run
- Test: Alarm -> banana -> dress/stretch during 30 min wait
- Hypothesis: More efficient use of morning time, especially as work gets busier

**Experiment 2: Post-run recovery snack**
- Test: Add protein after run (Greek yogurt? Protein shake?)
- Hypothesis: Better recovery, less afternoon energy dip
- Measure: Soreness next day, afternoon energy

**Experiment 3: Weekly long run positioning**
- Current: Friday is longest run
- Test: Wednesday as longest run? (leaves Fri/Sat/Sun recovery before Mon)
- Hypothesis: Better Monday performance
- Note: May not matter for 20-25 minute runs, but worth testing

## Challenges & Obstacles

**Work busy season approaching:**
- December/January = peak busy for accountants
- Longer hours, more stress, less flexibility
- Need to protect morning run time even more
- May need to run at 6 AM instead of 7 AM

**Weather getting colder:**
- 45-50 degrees F this week
- 30s-40s expected in coming weeks
- Need: running gloves? Ear warmers?
- Risk: cold becomes excuse to skip

**Maintenance after Week 8:**
- Two weeks until program completes
- Then what? Keep running 3x/week?
- Fear: losing momentum after "finish line"
- Need plan for Week 9+

**Fatigue accumulation:**
- Six weeks of consistent training = body adapting
- But also: minor aches here and there
- Left knee awareness Friday = reminder to listen to body
- Need balance: push vs protect

## Insights

**Progressive overload works (scientifically and emotionally):**
- 20 minutes felt hard to imagine three weeks ago
- Today it felt manageable
- That's the program design - trust it

**Experiments compound:**
- Fueling + hydration + active recovery = all working together
- Each individually small, but combined = big difference
- Systems > heroic effort

**Identity shift is real:**
- Week 1-3: "I'm trying to become a runner"
- Week 4-5: "I'm doing a running program"
- Week 6: "I'm a runner"
- Language change = mindset change

**Rest days are part of training:**
- Active recovery walks felt indulgent at first
- But Monday runs prove: rest is productive
- Recovery isn't "not training" - it's training

**External stress tests the habit:**
- Work stress increasing
- Habit is strong enough to withstand it (so far)
- That's the point: build sustainable practice that survives real life

**The finish line brings new questions:**
- Excited to complete Week 8
- Also: anxious about "then what?"
- Need to think about maintenance plan

## Gratitude

**For the plan:**
- Week 6 is hard in theory (20 min continuous)
- But the program prepared me perfectly
- Gradual progression = success

**For experiments working:**
- Fueling, hydration, recovery - all successful
- Feels like I'm learning my body's patterns
- That knowledge will outlast the program

**For consistency:**
- Six weeks, 18 runs, 0 missed workouts
- That's something to be proud of

**For body adaptation:**
- Resting heart rate dropped
- Weight down 8 lbs
- Legs stronger, lungs better
- Age 39 body is still capable of change

**For cold weather gear:**
- Could have used cold as excuse
- Instead: bought shirt, adapted, kept going

## Next Week Preview (Week 7)

**Program plan:**
- 3 runs: Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- Target: 25-minute continuous runs
- Another 25% jump (20 -> 25 min)

**Focus areas:**
- Morning routine optimization (use 30-min wait efficiently)
- Post-run recovery nutrition (protein)
- Protect morning run time despite work stress

**Watch out for:**
- Work hours increasing (busy season)
- Weather continuing to drop (gloves needed?)
- Mental resistance to 25-minute milestone
- Maintenance planning anxiety

**Commitment:**
- Complete all 3 runs (only 6 runs left in program!)
- Trust body to handle 25 minutes (it will)
- Start thinking about Week 9+ plan
