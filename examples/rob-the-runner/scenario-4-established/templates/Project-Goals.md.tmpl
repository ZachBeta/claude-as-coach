# Project Goals

## Primary Focus
Couch-to-5K running program - getting back in shape to keep up with my kids

## The Real Why
Playing tag with my kids (6 and 8) and having to sit down after 10 minutes while they wanted to keep going. I don't want to be the winded dad on the sidelines.

## Target Outcome
Complete 8-week C25K program, then maintain ability to run/play actively with kids

## Program Structure
- **Duration:** 8 weeks ({{W1_START}} - {{W8_END}})
- **Schedule:** Monday / Wednesday / Friday
- **Week 1 Start:** {{W1_START_FULL}}
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Week 8 finished {{W8_END}})

## Key Metrics
- Completed runs (M/W/F adherence)
- How the run felt (1-5 or qualitative)
- Any physical notes (soreness, energy, sleep impact)

## Timezone
America/New_York

## Daily/Weekly Workflow

**Morning:** "good morning" or "gm" -> loads yesterday's summary, generates brief

**End of Day:** "daily summary" -> structured reflection (timeline, key numbers, insights)
- Saves as: `Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-WX-DY.md`

**End of Week:** "weekly retro" -> reflect on what worked/didn't, identify adjustments

**Start of Week:** "weekly planning" -> set week's focus, anticipate obstacles

**Tips:**
- Log your runs with timestamps ("7am - Week 1 Day 1 run, felt hard but finished")
- Note how you felt before/during/after
- Rest days matter too - note sleep, soreness, energy

## Post-Program Phase (Current)

**Week 9+:** Exploring what comes next
- Maintaining 3x/week running
