# Weekly-Retro-{{W7_START}}-to-{{W7_END_DD}}-W7

**Week:** {{W7_MONTH}} {{W7_START_DD}}-{{W7_END_DD}}, {{YEAR}} (Week 7 of 8)
**Program phase:** Peak week - 25-minute continuous runs, final preparation

## Week Summary

Week 7 complete - the penultimate week before program completion. Hit 25-minute continuous runs on all three days. This is peak training week: highest duration before Week 8 taper/completion. Work stress high (busy season fully underway), but habit strong enough to withstand it. Weather cold (35-45°F), required full cold-weather gear. One week left. Feeling mix of excitement and "what happens after?"

**Key metrics:**
- Runs completed: 3 of 3
- Total distance: ~10 miles
- Average pace: ~11:40 min/mi (continuing improvement)
- Weight: 193 lbs (10 lbs down from start)
- Sleep average: 7.2 hours (dipped slightly due to work stress)
- Missed workouts: 0

## What Worked This Week

**25-minute milestone crushed:**
- All three runs: 25 minutes continuous, no walking
- Week 1: couldn't run 5 minutes
- Week 7: 25 minutes feels achievable
- That's 500% improvement in 7 weeks

**Morning routine optimization (SUCCESS):**
- New routine: Alarm → banana → dress/stretch during wait → run
- More efficient, less standing around
- Helped when mornings got tighter due to work

**Post-run protein experiment (MIXED):**
- Monday: Greek yogurt post-run (felt good)
- Wednesday: Forgot (no noticeable difference)
- Friday: Protein shake (felt better than nothing, but not as good as yogurt)
- Conclusion: Yogurt wins, but not critical

**Cold weather gear dialed in:**
- Long-sleeve shirt + running gloves + ear warmer
- 35°F Friday morning: stayed warm entire run
- No more excuses about weather

**Habit withstanding work stress:**
- Busiest work week since program started
- Still ran 3x, still got it done
- Proof: habit is resilient

**Pace improvement without trying:**
- Average 11:40 min/mi (was 12:00 in Week 5)
- Not pushing for speed - just happens
- Cardiovascular adaptation visible

## What Didn't Work This Week

**Sleep quality down:**
- Average 7.2 hours (down from 7.5 last week)
- Work stress → later bedtimes
- Wednesday run felt harder (only 6.5 hours sleep Tuesday night)
- Need to protect sleep even when work crazy

**Weekend active recovery skipped:**
- Saturday: too tired, skipped walk
- Sunday: Thanksgiving prep, no walk
- Monday morning: felt slightly stiff (proof that active recovery helps)

**Mental game wavering:**
- Monday: excited for Week 7
- Wednesday: felt dread ("25 minutes is long")
- Friday: back to confident
- Emotional ups and downs this week

**Post-run stretching rushed:**
- Time pressure from work = cut stretching short (5 min vs 10-15 min)
- Friday: calves felt tight Saturday
- Shortcuts have consequences

## Progress Toward Goal

**Program checkpoint:**
- Week 7 of 8 complete (87.5% done)
- Currently: 25-minute continuous runs
- Next week: 30 minutes (5K distance) = GOAL
- One week away from completion

**Body adaptation:**
- Cardiovascular: can sustain 25 minutes comfortably (huge!)
- Muscular: strong, minimal soreness
- Weight: 10 lbs down (203 → 193)
- Resting heart rate: 65 bpm (down from 74 Week 1)
- Energy levels: noticeably higher than pre-program

**Mental game:**
- Confidence wavering slightly (work stress bleeding into runs)
- But: still showing up, still completing runs
- That matters more than feeling 100% confident

**Habit formation:**
- 7 weeks, 21 runs, 0 missed workouts
- Even in busiest work week, habit held
- That's the point: sustainability through adversity

## Experiments Results Summary

**From Week 6 experiments:**

| Experiment | Result | Keep? |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Morning routine optimization | More efficient, less wasted time | YES - keep |
| Post-run protein (yogurt) | Slightly helpful, not critical | MAYBE - yogurt if convenient |
| Long run positioning | Didn't test (kept Friday) | N/A - defer |

## New Experiments for Week 8 (Final Week)

**No new experiments.**

Week 8 is about execution, not experimentation. Use what worked:
- Fueling: Banana 30 min before
- Hydration: Water before bed
- Routine: Efficient morning flow
- Gear: Cold weather setup
- Recovery: Active walks on weekend (don't skip!)

Focus: Finish strong, celebrate completion, plan for Week 9+.

## Challenges & Obstacles

**Work stress at peak:**
- Busy season in full swing
- 50-hour work weeks
- Mental energy depleted
- Running is refuge, but also one more thing on schedule

**Sleep sacrificed for work:**
- Later bedtimes to finish projects
- Morning runs non-negotiable → less sleep overall
- Catch-22: need sleep for recovery, need work hours for deadlines

**Thanksgiving week ahead:**
- Week 8 includes Thanksgiving (Thursday Nov 28)
- Disrupted routine, travel, family, food
- Risk: using holiday as excuse to skip Friday run
- Plan: Run Monday, Wednesday, Friday (Thanksgiving is built-in rest day)

**The finish line anxiety:**
- One week left in program
- Excited to finish, but also: "then what?"
- Fear of losing momentum post-program
- Need concrete plan for Week 9+

**Accumulated fatigue:**
- Seven weeks of consistent training = body tired
- Not injured, but little aches and awareness
- Need to finish strong without pushing into injury

## Insights

**Peak week is mentally harder than expected:**
- Physically, 25 minutes was fine
- Mentally, work stress + program stress = compound effect
- The habit held, but it wasn't easy

**Habit is resilient but not invincible:**
- Withstood busiest work week so far
- But sleep suffered, recovery shortcuts taken
- Sustainable ≠ effortless

**The program works because it ends:**
- Eight weeks is long enough to build habit
- But short enough to see finish line
- Infinite programs lose motivation - this has structure

**Rest days are non-negotiable:**
- Skipped weekend walks = Monday stiffness
- Recovery isn't optional - it's part of training
- Shortcuts have consequences

**Completion brings new questions:**
- Week 1-7: focus on "can I do this?"
- Week 8: focus shifts to "how do I keep this?"
- Success creates new challenge: maintenance

**External stress doesn't pause for fitness goals:**
- Work doesn't care about my running program
- Life doesn't pause for eight weeks
- That's why building sustainable habits matters

## Gratitude

**For showing up:**
- Busiest work week of the program
- Still ran 3x
- That's worth celebrating

**For 25-minute milestone:**
- Seven weeks ago: unimaginable
- This week: done three times
- Progress is real

**For one week left:**
- Finish line visible
- Most people don't finish what they start
- I'm going to be one who does

**For the struggle:**
- This week was hard (work + running + life)
- But I did it anyway
- That builds character and confidence

**For cold weather gear:**
- Could have quit when it got cold
- Instead: adapted, kept going
- Removes excuses

## Next Week Preview (Week 8 - FINAL WEEK)

**Program plan:**
- 3 runs: Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- Target: 30-minute continuous runs (or 5K distance)
- THIS IS IT - program completion week

**Schedule notes:**
- Monday Nov 25: Run (normal)
- Tuesday Nov 26: Rest
- Wednesday Nov 27: Run (normal)
- Thursday Nov 28: Thanksgiving (rest day, built in)
- Friday Nov 29: Run (FINAL RUN OF PROGRAM)

**Focus areas:**
- Execute what works (no new experiments)
- Protect morning run time despite holiday chaos
- Finish strong, injury-free
- Celebrate completion

**Watch out for:**
- Thanksgiving disruption (travel, food, family)
- Temptation to skip Friday ("holiday week, who cares?")
- Pushing too hard on final run (ego vs smart training)
- Post-program momentum loss

**Post-program planning:**
- Need concrete plan for Week 9+
- Options: Maintain 3x/week? Sign up for 5K race? New goal?
- Decision by Friday: what comes next?

**Commitment:**
- Complete all 3 runs this week
- Finish the program injury-free
- Celebrate completion (plan something, even small)
- Define Week 9+ plan by Friday

## Reflection: Seven Weeks In

**What I've learned:**
- Consistency compounds (1% better each day = transformation)
- Habits beat motivation (motivation fades, habits persist)
- Progress is gradual, then obvious
- External stress tests habits - that's when they matter most
- Identity shift: "I'm trying to run" → "I'm a runner"

**What I've proven:**
- Age 39 isn't too late to start
- Sedentary → runner in 8 weeks is possible
- Couch-to-5K program works (exactly as designed)
- I can commit to something and follow through

**What I'm taking forward:**
- The system (daily summaries, weekly retros) helps
- Small increments work better than heroic efforts
- Recovery is part of training, not absence of training
- Running isn't the goal - it's the practice
- The real goal: be capable, energized, present for life

**One week left. Let's finish this.**
