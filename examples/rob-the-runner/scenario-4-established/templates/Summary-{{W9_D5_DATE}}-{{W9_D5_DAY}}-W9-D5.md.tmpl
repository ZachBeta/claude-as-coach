# Summary-{{W9_D5_DATE}}-{{W9_D5_DAY}}-W9-D5

**Date:** {{W9_D5_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 9, Day 5 - End of first post-program week

## TL;DR

Wrapped up Week 9 with an easy 3-mile run. Felt like a "bridge week" - not training for anything specific, but maintaining momentum. Did yoga with wife after work (3rd session this week). Getting slightly less terrible at it. Weekend plans: Saturday morning run, then maybe a longer yoga flow? Program's done, but the habits are sticking.

## Key Numbers

**Running:**
- Distance: 3.0 miles
- Duration: ~33 minutes
- Pace: ~11:00 min/mi (comfortable)
- Heart rate avg: ~150 bpm
- Consistent all week

**Yoga:**
- Session: 25 minutes (beginner-intermediate)
- Difficulty: 7/10 (slight improvement)
- Wife's patience: infinity/10 (she's a saint)

**General:**
- Weight: 190 lbs (down 1 lb this week!)
- Sleep: 7 hours
- Energy: 8/10

## Timeline

**6:30 AM** - Morning run
- Same comfortable 3-mile route
- Body feels good - no aches
- Mind wandering: "What do I train for next?"
- Not urgent, just curious

**9:00 AM - 5:30 PM** - Work
- Friday = less intense, admin tasks
- Quarterly reports finalized (done!)

**6:00 PM** - Yoga with wife
- 25-minute flow
- First time attempting crow pose (failed hilariously)
- Wife demonstrated, I fell over
- We both laughed - that's the point?

**8:00 PM** - Dinner conversation
- Talked about "what's next" for fitness
- No pressure to decide now
- Maybe a 10K in spring?
- Maybe yoga teacher training for her?
- For now: just keep moving

## Insights

**Pattern recognition:** Week 9 felt like a "breath" after the intensity of Week 8. The couch-to-5K program structure is gone, but the habits remain. Running 3 days/week feels normal now. Yoga 2-3x/week is becoming normal too.

**The yoga surprise:** I thought yoga would be "easy" compared to running. It's not. Different hard. Balance is humbling. But there's something about struggling through a pose with my wife that feels... connective? Not just fitness, but time together.

**Energy observation:** No big energy swings this week. Steady 7-8/10 most days. Sleep consistent. Weight trending down (finally broke 191). This is what "sustainable" feels like?

## Decisions & Next

**For tomorrow (Saturday):**
- Morning run: 3-4 miles, easy pace
- Afternoon: Try a longer yoga flow (45 min) with wife

**For Week 10:**
- Continue run 3x/week pattern (Mon/Wed/Fri or Sat)
- Yoga 3x/week pattern (Tues/Thurs/weekend)
- No new experiments - let this week's pattern settle
- Maybe start thinking about a 10K goal for spring?

**No big decisions needed.** Just keep going.
