# Summary-{{W9_D2_DATE}}-{{W9_D2_DAY}}-W9-D2

**Date:** {{W9_D2_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 9, Day 2 - Post-program exploration

## TL;DR

Morning run done (3 miles, easy). Evening: tried yoga with wife for the first time. Verdict: harder than expected, humbling in a good way, and... I think I want to do it again? Not because I'm "good" at it (I'm terrible), but because it challenged me in ways running doesn't. Balance is HARD. Breathing is HARD. Holding still is harder than moving. Wife was patient and didn't laugh (much). This might be the thing.

## Key Numbers

**Running:**
- Distance: 3.0 miles
- Duration: ~34 minutes
- Pace: ~11:20 min/mi (slightly faster, felt good)
- Heart rate avg: ~148 bpm
- No issues

**Yoga (first session):**
- Duration: 20 minutes (beginner flow)
- Difficulty: 8/10 (way harder than expected)
- Frustration level: 6/10 (couldn't do half the poses)
- Satisfaction level: 7/10 (felt good afterwards, despite struggling)

**General:**
- Weight: 191 lbs
- Sleep: 7.5 hours (better than Monday)
- Energy: 8/10 all day

## Timeline

**7:00 AM** - Morning run
- Same route, felt strong
- Legs loose, no soreness
- Mind wandering: "Am I actually going to do yoga tonight or chicken out?"

**9:00 AM** - Work day
- Productive (caught up on quarterly reports)
- Minimal distraction (usually check phone more)

**12:30 PM** - Lunch
- Wife texted: "Still on for yoga tonight? No pressure."
- Me: "Yeah, let's do it. Low expectations though."
- Her: "That's the right attitude."

**6:00 PM** - Pre-yoga nerves
- Realized I was nervous (why?? It's just stretching...)
- Ego thing? Fear of being bad at something?

**7:00 PM** - Yoga session (20 minutes beginner flow)
- Setup: Living room, yoga mat borrowed from wife, YouTube video
- Wife next to me, demonstrating when I got lost

**Specific moments:**
- **Minute 1-3:** "This is fine, just breathing and standing."
- **Minute 4:** First balance pose (tree pose?). Wobbled immediately. Wife stable as a statue. How?
- **Minute 6:** Downward dog. Arms shaking. "How long do we hold this??" (felt like 5 minutes, was probably 30 seconds)
- **Minute 8:** Some twisting thing. Couldn't reach where the instructor reached. Tight hips/back.
- **Minute 10:** Plank. "Wait, this is just a plank. I can do this." (arms shaking again after 20 seconds)
- **Minute 12:** Another balance pose. Fell out of it twice. Wife: "It's okay, happens to everyone."
- **Minute 15:** Some seated forward fold. Couldn't touch my toes. When did I lose this much flexibility?
- **Minute 18:** Lying twist. First pose that felt *good*. Back released, felt relief.
- **Minute 20:** Final rest pose (savasana). Instructor: "Let your body relax." Me: *immediately fell asleep for 2 minutes*

**7:25 PM** - Post-yoga debrief
- Me: "Well. That was humbling."
- Her: "You did great for your first time!"
- Me: "I fell out of half the poses."
- Her: "Yeah, but you tried all of them. That's what matters."
- Me: "My arms are shaking."
- Her: "That means you worked."

**7:30 PM** - Honest reflection
- Me: "Okay, real talk. That was way harder than I thought."
- Her: "I know."
- Me: "But also... I think I want to do it again?"
- Her: *surprised* "Really?"
- Me: "Yeah. It challenged me differently. Running is cardiovascular, this is... I don't even know what to call it."
- Her: "Strength, flexibility, balance, breath control, patience."
- Me: "All the things I'm bad at."
- Her: "That's why it's good for you."

## What Worked

**Showing up despite nerves:**
- Could have bailed (work excuse, tired, whatever)
- Didn't. That's progress.

**Low expectations = pleasant surprise:**
- Went in expecting to hate it or feel ridiculous
- Struggled, yes, but didn't hate it
- Actually felt... curious? Challenged?

**Wife's patience:**
- She didn't correct me constantly
- Let me figure it out
- Encouraging without being condescending
- This is a good couple activity

**Noticing what's hard:**
- Balance = way harder than I expected
- Flexibility = lost more than I realized
- Holding still = paradoxically harder than moving
- These are real gaps in my fitness

**The post-yoga feeling:**
- Body felt... relaxed? Opened?
- Different from post-run endorphins
- More like "tension I didn't know I had is gone"

## What Didn't Work

**Ego getting in the way:**
- Frustrated when I couldn't do poses wife could do
- She's been doing this (inconsistently) for years - of course she's better
- Need to compete with myself, not her

**Breathing:**
- Instructor kept saying "breathe deeply"
- I kept holding my breath during hard poses
- This is apparently the opposite of what you're supposed to do

**Form probably terrible:**
- No idea if I'm doing poses correctly
- Risk of injury if form is way off?
- Might need actual class (not just YouTube) eventually

**Time commitment question:**
- 20-minute class took 30 minutes (setup, breaks, debrief)
- Plus morning run = over an hour of exercise today
- Is that sustainable long-term?

## Insights

**"Bad at something" is refreshing:**
- I got competent at running (3 miles feels easy now)
- Yoga: I'm a complete beginner again
- That's... motivating?
- Being bad means high ROI for improvement

**Different than running (complementary?):**
- Running: forward motion, cardiovascular, rhythmic
- Yoga: stillness, balance, flexibility, breath
- They don't compete - they complement
- Running builds engine, yoga builds chassis?

**Couple activity unlocked:**
- We did something together (not just parallel)
- She was the expert, I was the beginner
- Role reversal from usual (I'm usually the "competent" one)
- That was... nice? Different dynamic.

**The challenge isn't physical (only):**
- Holding still is mental challenge
- Patience with my body
- Not forcing, not straining
- That's harder for me than pushing harder (running mindset)

**I might actually want to do this:**
- Not "should" do it (for flexibility/recovery)
- Not "obligated" (for wife's sake)
- Genuinely curious: what would I be like if I got good at this?

**Sustainability question matters:**
- Can I run 3x/week AND yoga 2x/week?
- That's 5 days of intentional movement
- Plus work, family, life
- Need to test if that's sustainable or overwhelming

## Tomorrow's Focus

**Rest day:**
- No formal exercise (Thursday rest day per plan)
- Light activity: walk with kids after work
- Notice: how does body feel after run + yoga?

**Reflection question:**
- Do I want to try yoga again because it's interesting?
- Or because wife wants me to?
- Honest answer will determine whether to continue

**Weekend decision:**
- Saturday: second yoga session? Or try calisthenics?
- Don't need to decide now, but think about it

## Notes

- First yoga session: complete
- Harder than expected (good)
- Humbling (also good)
- Want to try again (surprising)
- Wife happy (bonus)

**The real question:** Is this exploration phase, or is this the new practice forming?

**Honest answer:** Too early to tell. But I'm genuinely curious now. And curiosity is a better motivator than obligation.

**Next:** See if I still want to do it on Saturday (when the novelty wears off).
