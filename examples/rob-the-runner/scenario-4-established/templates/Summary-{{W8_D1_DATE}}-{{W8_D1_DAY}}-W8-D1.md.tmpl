# Summary-{{W8_D1_DATE}}-{{W8_D1_DAY}}-W8-D1

**Date:** {{W8_D1_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 8, Day 1 of couch-to-5K program (final week!)

## TL;DR

First run of the final week - 2.8 miles completed at comfortable pace. Body feels adapted to regular running now. Some pre-run nervousness about "final week," but reminded myself to trust the process. Work day went well, energy levels noticeably higher than early program weeks.

## Key Numbers

- **Run distance:** 2.8 miles (target 3.0)
- **Run duration:** ~33 minutes
- **Average pace:** ~11:45 min/mi
- **Heart rate average:** 152 bpm (felt aerobic, not straining)
- **Morning weight:** 192 lbs (down from 203 at program start)
- **Sleep:** 7.5 hours
- **Pre-run energy:** 7/10
- **Post-run energy:** 8/10

## Timeline

**6:30 AM** - Morning routine, light breakfast (banana, water)
- Set alarm earlier this week to avoid rushing
- Felt more rested than usual

**7:15 AM** - Warmup routine
- 5-minute walk around neighborhood
- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm circles)
- No soreness from Friday's run

**7:20 AM** - Run begins
- First mile: felt strong, resisted urge to go fast
- Mile 2: settled into comfortable rhythm
- Last 0.8 mi: slight fatigue but finished strong
- Stopped at 2.8 mi to avoid overdoing it

**8:00 AM** - Cooldown
- 5-minute walk back home
- Static stretching: calves, quads, hamstrings
- Hydration: 16 oz water

**9:00 AM** - Work day begins
- Showered, fed, feeling accomplished
- Energy noticeably better than pre-program baseline

**12:30 PM** - Lunch break
- Normal lunch, no unusual hunger
- Quick 10-minute walk outside

**6:00 PM** - Evening wind-down
- Light soreness in calves (expected, manageable)
- Foam rolling: 10 minutes

**10:00 PM** - Prep for Tuesday (rest day)
- Set reminder to hydrate tomorrow
- Laid out gear for Wednesday's run

## What Worked

**Earlier start time:**
- Less rushed, more mindful during run
- Cooler morning temps (58°F vs usual 65°F+)
- Quieter neighborhood streets

**Pacing discipline:**
- Resisted urge to go fast in first mile
- Stayed comfortable throughout
- Finished feeling like I could have done more (good sign)

**Pre-run fueling:**
- Banana + water 30 min before = no stomach issues
- Consistent with what worked in Week 7

**Recovery mindset:**
- Stopped at 2.8 instead of pushing to 3.0
- Prioritizing consistency over distance this week

## What Didn't Work

**Hydration last night:**
- Forgot to drink water before bed
- Slight headache mid-run (minutes 15-20)
- Resolved after post-run hydration, but avoidable

**Pace monitoring:**
- Didn't bring watch, so pace is estimated
- Would help to have real-time feedback

**Post-run stretching:**
- Rushed through it a bit (only ~5 minutes)
- Should have taken 10 minutes

## Insights

**Week 8 confidence is real:**
- Not nervous about the runs themselves anymore
- Nervous about "finishing the program" (mental, not physical)
- Body has adapted - this feels normal now

**Progress is tangible:**
- 11 lbs lost since program start
- Used to get winded playing with kids - now running 2.8 miles
- Morning energy consistently better

**Trust the program:**
- Tempting to push harder in final week
- But program worked by progressive overload, not heroics
- Need to finish injury-free and build sustainable habit

**Sustainability over perfection:**
- Missing exact distance targets (2.8 vs 3.0) isn't failure
- Consistency matters more than single-run performance
- This is about building a practice, not one-time achievement

## Tomorrow's Focus

**Rest day protocols:**
- Active recovery: 20-minute walk after work
- Foam rolling: 15 minutes (calves, IT band, quads)
- Hydrate tonight: set phone reminder

**Wednesday prep:**
- Lay out running gear Tuesday night
- Banana + water 30 min before (repeat what worked today)
- Target 3.0 miles at comfortable pace

**Mental game:**
- This is the final week - stay consistent
- Don't overthink it, trust the process
- Focus on completing runs, not PRs

## Notes

- Week 8 = culmination of 8 weeks of consistency
- 3 runs this week: Monday (done), Wednesday, Friday
- After Friday: officially completed couch-to-5K!
- Already thinking about "what's next" (maintain 3x/week? sign up for actual 5K race?)
