# Summary-{{W8_D2_DATE}}-{{W8_D2_DAY}}-W8-D2

**Date:** {{W8_D2_FULL}}
**Context:** Week 8, Day 2 of couch-to-5K program

## TL;DR

Mid-week run completed - hit 3.1 miles (first time breaking 3 miles!). Pace felt comfortable, no major issues. Slight knee twinge in mile 2 (watched it closely, didn't worsen). Work day productive despite Thanksgiving prep on mind. Realized I'm actually going to finish this program.

## Key Numbers

- **Run distance:** 3.1 miles (exceeded target!)
- **Run duration:** ~36 minutes
- **Average pace:** ~11:35 min/mi (slightly faster than Monday)
- **Heart rate average:** ~155 bpm (slightly elevated but manageable)
- **Morning weight:** 191 lbs (continuing downward trend)
- **Sleep:** 8 hours (great night)
- **Pre-run energy:** 8/10
- **Post-run energy:** 7/10 (more fatigued than Monday)

## Timeline

**6:30 AM** - Morning routine
- Felt well-rested (8 hours sleep helped)
- Banana + water 30 min before run

**7:15 AM** - Warmup
- 5-minute neighborhood walk
- Dynamic stretches (extra attention to knees today)

**7:20 AM** - Run begins
- Mile 1: Strong start, good rhythm
- Mile 2: Slight knee twinge at ~1.7 mi (left knee, medial side)
  - Slowed pace slightly, monitored closely
  - Didn't worsen, continued
- Mile 3: Pushed through to 3.1 miles
  - Realized I'd broken 3 miles for first time
  - Small win!

**8:05 AM** - Cooldown
- Extended cooldown walk (10 minutes)
- Focused on knee - felt fine walking
- Ice pack on left knee for 15 minutes (precautionary)

**9:15 AM** - Work begins (later start)
- Showered, iced knee, delayed work start
- Felt accomplished but slightly concerned about knee

**12:30 PM** - Lunch
- Knee feels normal (no pain during regular movement)
- 10-minute walk felt fine

**3:00 PM** - Afternoon slump
- Energy dipped mid-afternoon (more than usual)
- Possible: pushed harder during run than I realized

**6:00 PM** - Evening
- Knee still feels normal (relief!)
- Light stretching, foam rolling

**9:00 PM** - Thanksgiving prep
- Prep for holiday tomorrow (rest day built in)
- Grateful for how far I've come in 8 weeks

## What Worked

**Sleep quality:**
- 8 hours made a noticeable difference
- Felt energized pre-run

**Breaking 3 miles:**
- First time exceeding 3.0 mi
- Psychological milestone ("I can run a 5K distance")

**Monitoring knee closely:**
- Felt twinge, slowed down, assessed
- Didn't push through pain
- Didn't turn into injury

**Extended cooldown:**
- 10-minute walk vs usual 5 minutes
- Ice on knee = proactive recovery

## What Didn't Work

**Pace management:**
- Went slightly faster than Monday (11:35 vs 11:45)
- May have contributed to knee twinge
- May have caused afternoon energy dip

**Pushing to 3.1 miles:**
- Excited to break 3.0, but didn't plan to go beyond
- Slight ego win, but was it necessary?
- Should prioritize consistency over milestones right now

**Afternoon energy:**
- More fatigued than Monday post-run
- Didn't eat enough post-run? Or just pushed harder?

## Insights

**The finish line is in sight:**
- Week 8, Day 2 = one run left in program (Friday)
- Starting to feel emotional about completing this
- 8 weeks ago, couldn't run 1 mile continuously

**Injury prevention > performance:**
- Knee twinge was a warning
- Body is adapting, but still vulnerable
- Final week is NOT the time to push for PRs
- Goal: finish healthy, build sustainable habit

**Progress isn't linear:**
- Monday felt easier than today
- Today was longer distance but more fatigue
- That's normal - not every run will be a "best run"

**Context matters:**
- Thanksgiving tomorrow = disrupted routine ahead
- Family obligations, food, travel
- Need to stay flexible, not rigid

**I'm actually going to finish this:**
- Started this program feeling skeptical
- "Can I really go from couch to running?"
- 8 weeks later: yes, apparently I can

## Tomorrow's Focus (Thanksgiving)

**Rest day + holiday:**
- No run scheduled (built-in rest)
- Active recovery: walk with family after Thanksgiving meal
- Stay hydrated despite holiday chaos
- Don't stress about food/routine disruption

**Friday prep:**
- Final run of program on Friday
- Keep it simple: 3.0 miles at comfortable pace
- Don't push for speed or distance PR
- Goal: finish healthy and celebrate completion

**Knee monitoring:**
- Pay attention to left knee next 2 days
- If any pain/swelling: skip Friday run or modify
- Completing program matters, but not at expense of injury

## Notes

- Broke 3 miles for first time (3.1 mi)
- Slight knee concern (monitored, resolved)
- One run left in program (Friday, Week 8 Day 3)
- Emotional milestone: realizing I'm going to finish this
- Thanksgiving tomorrow = disrupted schedule, but that's okay
